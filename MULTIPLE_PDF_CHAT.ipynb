As my classmate took a full swing, the bat\n","slipped out of his hands and came \u0000ying toward me before striking me\n","directly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of impact.\n","e bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose\n","into a distorted U-shape. e collision sent the so tissue of my brain\n","slamming into the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of swelling surged\n","throughout my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose, multiple\n","skull fractures, and two shattered eye sockets.\n","When I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to\n","help. I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my\n","classmates took the shirt oﬀ his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug\n","the stream of blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I\n","was unaware of how seriously I had been injured.\n","My teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long\n","walk to the nurse’s oﬃce: across the \u0000eld, down the hill, and back into\n","school. Random hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We took our\n","time and walked slowly. Nobody realized that every minute mattered.\n","When we arrived at the nurse’s oﬃce, she asked me a series of questions.\n","“What year is it?”\n","“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.\n","“Who is the president of the United States?”\n","“Bill Clinton,” I said. e correct answer was George W. Bush.\n","“What is your mom’s name?”\n","“Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.“Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds\n","to remember my own mother’s name.\n","at is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle the\n","rapid swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the ambulance\n","arrived. Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken to the local\n","hospital.\n","Shortly aer arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with\n","basic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my \u0000rst seizure of the\n","day. en I stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors hurried to supply me\n","with oxygen, they also decided the local hospital was unequipped to handle\n","the situation and ordered a helicopter to \u0000y me to a larger hospital in\n","Cincinnati.\n","I was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the helipad\n","across the street. e stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one nurse\n","pushed me along while another pumped each breath into me by hand. My\n","mother, who had arrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed into\n","the helicopter beside me. I remained unconscious and unable to breathe on\n","my own as she held my hand during the \u0000ight.\n","While my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my father went home\n","to check on my brother and sister and break the news to them. He choked\n","back tears as he explained to my sister that he would miss her eighth-grade\n","graduation ceremony that night. Aer passing my siblings oﬀ to family and\n","friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my mother.\n","When my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of nearly\n","twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and wheeled me into\n","the trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain had become so severe\n","that I was having repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones needed\n","to be \u0000xed, but I was in no condition to undergo surgery. Aer yet another\n","seizure—my third of the day—I was put into a medically induced coma and\n","placed on a ventilator.\n","My parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier, they had\n","entered the same building on the ground \u0000oor aer my sister was diagnosed\n","with leukemia at age three. I was \u0000ve at the time. My brother was just six\n","months old. Aer two and a half years of chemotherapy treatments, spinal\n","taps, and bone marrow biopsies, my little sister \u0000nally walked out of the\n","hospital happy, healthy, and cancer free. And now, aer ten years of normallife, my parents found themselves back in the same place with a diﬀerent\n","child.\n","While I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social worker\n","to comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met with them a\n","decade earlier on the evening they found out my sister had cancer.\n","As day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My parents\n","slept restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they would collapse\n","from fatigue, the next they would be wide awake with worry. My mother\n","would tell me later, “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”\n","MY RECOVER Y\n","Mercifully, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the point\n","where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma. When I\n","\u0000nally regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my ability to\n","smell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniﬀ an apple juice\n","box. My sense of smell returned, but—to everyone’s surprise—the act of\n","blowing my nose forced air through the fractures in my eye socket and\n","pushed my le eye outward. My eyeball bulged out of the socket, held\n","precariously in place by my eyelid and the optic nerve attaching my eye to\n","my brain.\n","e ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into place as\n","the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would take. I was\n","scheduled for surgery one week later, which would allow me some\n","additional time to heal. I looked like I had been on the wrong end of a\n","boxing match, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I returned home with a\n","broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a bulging le eye.\n","e following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on\n","pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn’t see straight. It took\n","more than a month, but my eyeball did eventually return to its normal\n","location. Between the seizures and my vision problems, it was eight months\n","before I could drive a car again. At physical therapy, I practiced basic motor\n","patterns like walking in a straight line. I was determined not to let my injury\n","get me down, but there were more than a few moments when I felt\n","depressed and overwhelmed.I became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to the\n","baseball \u0000eld one year later. Baseball had always been a major part of my life.\n","My dad had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, and I\n","had a dream of playing professionally, too. Aer months of rehabilitation,\n","what I wanted more than anything was to get back on the \u0000eld.\n","But my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled\n","around, I was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. I was\n","sent down to play with the sophomores on junior varsity. I had been playing\n","since age four, and for someone who had spent so much time and eﬀort on\n","the sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividly remember the day it\n","happened. I sat in my car and cried as I \u0000ipped through the radio,\n","desperately searching for a song that would make me feel better.\n","Aer a year of self-doubt, I managed to make the varsity team as a senior,\n","but I rarely made it on the \u0000eld. In total, I played eleven innings of high\n","school varsity baseball, barely more than a single game.\n","Despite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I could become a\n","great player. And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one\n","responsible for making it happen. e turning point came two years aer\n","my injury, when I began college at Denison University. It was a new\n","beginning, and it was the place where I would discover the surprising power\n","of small habits for the \u0000rst time.\n","HOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS\n","Attending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned a spot\n","on the baseball team and, although I was at the bottom of the roster as a\n","freshman, I was thrilled. Despite the chaos of my high school years, I had\n","managed to become a college athlete.\n","I wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I\n","focused on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and\n","played video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each\n","night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room\n","neat and tidy. ese improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of\n","control over my life. I started to feel con\u0000dent again. And this growing beliefin myself rippled into the classroom as I improved my study habits and\n","managed to earn straight A’s during my \u0000rst year.\n","A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in\n","many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but\n","consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me\n","when I started. For example, for the \u0000rst time in my life, I made it a habit to\n","li weights multiple times per week, and in the years that followed, my six-\n","foot-four-inch frame bulked up from a featherweight 170 to a lean 200\n","pounds.\n","When my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on the\n","pitching staﬀ. By my junior year, I was voted team captain and at the end of\n","the season, I was selected for the all-conference team. But it was not until\n","my senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-training\n","habits really began to pay oﬀ.\n","Six years aer I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, \u0000own to the\n","hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male athlete at\n","Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America Team—\n","an honor given to just thirty-three players across the country. By the time I\n","graduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight diﬀerent\n","categories. at same year, I was awarded the university’s highest academic\n","honor, the President’s Medal.\n","I hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, there was\n","nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I never ended up\n","playing professionally. However, looking back on those years, I believe I\n","accomplished something just as rare: I ful\u0000lled my potential. And I believe\n","the concepts in this book can help you ful\u0000ll your potential as well.\n","We all face challenges in life. is injury was one of mine, and the\n","experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and\n","unimportant at \u0000rst will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing\n","to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run,\n","the quality of our lives oen depends on the quality of our habits. With the\n","same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits,\n","anything is possible.\n","Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight. I\n","don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. ere wasn’t one\n","de\u0000ning moment on my journey from medically induced coma to AcademicAll-American; there were many. It was a gradual evolution, a long series of\n","small wins and tiny breakthroughs. e only way I made progress—the only\n","choice I had—was to start small. And I employed this same strategy a few\n","years later when I started my own business and began working on this book.\n","HOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK\n","In November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. For years,\n","I had been keeping notes about my personal experiments with habits and I\n","was \u0000nally ready to share some of them publicly. I began by publishing a\n","new article every Monday and ursday. Within a few months, this simple\n","writing habit led to my \u0000rst one thousand email subscribers, and by the end\n","of 2013 that number had grown to more than thirty thousand people.\n","In 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand\n","subscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on the\n","internet. I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier,\n","but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label that\n","excited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had never considered myself a\n","master of the topic, but rather someone who was experimenting alongside\n","my readers.\n","In 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and signed a\n","book deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the book you are\n","reading now. As my audience grew, so did my business opportunities. I was\n","increasingly asked to speak at top companies about the science of habit\n","formation, behavior change, and continuous improvement. I found myself\n","delivering keynote speeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.\n","In 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publications like\n","Time, Entrepreneur, and Forbes. Incredibly, my writing was read by over\n","eight million people that year. Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and MLB began\n","reading my work and sharing it with their teams.\n","At the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy, which became the\n","premier training platform for organizations and individuals interested in\n","building better habits in life and work.* Fortune 500 companies and growing\n","start-ups began to enroll their leaders and train their staﬀ. In total, over ten\n","thousand leaders, managers, coaches, and teachers have graduated from theHabits Academy, and my work with them has taught me an incredible\n","amount about what it takes to make habits work in the real world.\n","As I put the \u0000nishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.com is\n","receiving millions of visitors per month and nearly \u0000ve hundred thousand\n","people subscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number that is so far\n","beyond my expectations when I began that I’m not even sure what to think\n","of it.\n","HOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOU\n","e entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great\n","book, you must \u0000rst become the book.” I originally learned about the ideas\n","mentioned here because I had to live them. I had to rely on small habits to\n","rebound from my injury, to get stronger in the gym, to perform at a high\n","level on the \u0000eld, to become a writer, to build a successful business, and\n","simply to develop into a responsible adult. Small habits helped me ful\u0000ll my\n","potential, and since you picked up this book, I’m guessing you’d like to ful\u0000ll\n","yours as well.\n","In the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for building\n","better habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While science\n","supports everything I’ve written, this book is not an academic research\n","paper; it’s an operating manual. You’ll \u0000nd wisdom and practical advice\n","front and center as I explain the science of how to create and change your\n","habits in a way that is easy to understand and apply.\n","e \u0000elds I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and\n","more—have been around for many years. What I oﬀer you is a synthesis of\n","the best ideas smart people \u0000gured out a long time ago as well as the most\n","compelling discoveries scientists have made recently. My contribution, I\n","hope, is to \u0000nd the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is\n","highly actionable. Anything wise in these pages you should credit to the\n","many experts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.\n","e backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving,\n","response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out\n","of these steps. Readers with a psychology background may recognize some\n","of these terms from operant conditioning, which was \u0000rst proposed as“stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been\n","popularized more recently as “cue, routine, reward” in e Power of Habit by\n","Charles Duhigg.\n","Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you oﬀered the right\n","reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But\n","while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how external\n","stimuli in\u0000uenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our\n","thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states—our\n","moods and emotions—matter, too. In recent decades, scientists have begun\n","to determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.\n","is research will also be covered in these pages.\n","In total, the framework I oﬀer is an integrated model of the cognitive and\n","behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the \u0000rst models of human behavior\n","to accurately account for both the in\u0000uence of external stimuli and internal\n","emotions on our habits. While some of the language may be familiar, I am\n","con\u0000dent that the details—and the applications of the Four Laws of\n","Behavior Change—will oﬀer a new way to think about your habits.\n","Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to\n","moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t change. It’s\n","about the fundamentals of human behavior. e lasting principles you can\n","rely on year aer year. e ideas you can build a business around, build a\n","family around, build a life around.\n","ere is no one right way to create better habits, but this book describes\n","the best way I know—an approach that will be eﬀective regardless of where\n","you start or what you’re trying to change. e strategies I cover will be\n","relevant to anyone looking for a step-by-step system for improvement,\n","whether your goals center on health, money, productivity, relationships, or\n","all of the above. As long as human behavior is involved, this book will be\n","your guide.T H E   \n","FUNDAMENT ALS\n","Why Tiny Changes Make a Big\n","DifferenceT\n","1\n","The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits\n","HE FATE OF British Cycling changed one day in 2003. e organization,\n","which was the governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain,\n","had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the\n","time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred\n","years of mediocrity. Since 1908, British riders had won just a single gold\n","medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even worse in cycling’s\n","biggest race, the Tour de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever\n","won the event.\n","In fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming\n","that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the\n","team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals\n","saw the Brits using their gear.\n","Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory.\n","What made him diﬀerent from previous coaches was his relentless\n","commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal\n","gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of\n","improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “e whole principle\n","came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of\n","that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a\n","signi\u0000cant increase when you put them all together.”\n","Brailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you might\n","expect from a professional cycling team. ey redesigned the bike seats tomake them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better\n","grip. ey asked riders to wear electrically heated overshorts to maintain\n","ideal muscle temperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to\n","monitor how each athlete responded to a particular workout. e team\n","tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch\n","to indoor racing suits, which proved to be lighter and more aerodynamic.\n","But they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to \u0000nd 1\n","percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. ey tested\n","diﬀerent types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle\n","recovery. ey hired a surgeon to teach each rider the best way to wash their\n","hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. ey determined the type of\n","pillow and mattress that led to the best night’s sleep for each rider. ey even\n","painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them spot little bits\n","of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the\n","performance of the \u0000nely tuned bikes.\n","As these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated, the\n","results came faster than anyone could have imagined.\n","Just \u0000ve years aer Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team\n","dominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in\n","Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals\n","available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games came to London, the\n","Brits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records and seven world\n","records.\n","at same year, Bradley Wiggins became the \u0000rst British cyclist to win\n","the Tour de France. e next year, his teammate Chris Froome won the race,\n","and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the British\n","team \u0000ve Tour de France victories in six years.\n","During the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178\n","world championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and\n","captured \u0000ve Tour de France victories in what is widely regarded as the most\n","successful run in cycling history.*\n","How does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes\n","transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at \u0000rst glance,\n","would seem to make a modest diﬀerence at best? Why do small\n","improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you\n","replicate this approach in your own life?WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE\n","It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one de\u0000ning moment and\n","underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too\n","oen, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.\n","Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a\n","championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to\n","make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.\n","Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes\n","it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the\n","long run. e diﬀerence a tiny improvement can make over time is\n","astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better\n","each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time\n","you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year,\n","you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor\n","setback accumulates into something much more.\n","1% BETTER EVER Y DA Y\n","1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03\n","1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78FIGURE 1: The effects of small habits compound over time. For\n","example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end\n","up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.\n","Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. e same way\n","that money multiplies through compound interest, the eﬀects of your habits\n","multiply as you repeat them. ey seem to make little diﬀerence on any\n","given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be\n","enormous. It is only when looking back two, \u0000ve, or perhaps ten years later\n","that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly\n","apparent.\n","is can be a diﬃcult concept to appreciate in daily life. We oen dismiss\n","small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment.\n","If you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the\n","gym three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for\n","an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the language. We make a fewchanges, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back\n","into our previous routines.\n","Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a\n","bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move\n","much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you.\n","If you procrastinate and put your project oﬀ until tomorrow, there will\n","usually be time to \u0000nish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss.\n","But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day aer day, by replicating poor\n","decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our\n","small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many\n","missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a\n","problem.\n","e impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the eﬀect of\n","shiing the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are \u0000ying\n","from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the\n","heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of\n","New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoﬀ—the nose of\n","the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magni\u0000ed across the entire\n","United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.*\n","Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very\n","diﬀerent destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent\n","worse seems insigni\u0000cant in the moment, but over the span of moments that\n","make up a lifetime these choices determine the diﬀerence between who you\n","are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-\n","in-a-lifetime transformations.\n","at said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right\n","now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path\n","toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current\n","trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but you\n","spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If\n","your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to end well. Conversely, if\n","you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you’re on the path\n","toward \u0000nancial freedom—even if you’re moving slower than you’d like.\n","Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a\n","lagging measure of your \u0000nancial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of\n","your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learninghabits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get\n","what you repeat.\n","If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is\n","follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices\n","will compound ten or twenty years down the line.

Tiny battles like\n","these are the ones that will de\u0000ne your future self.\n","Time magni\u0000es the margin between success and failure. It will multiply\n","whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make\n","time your enemy.\n","Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as\n","easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the\n","details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design\n","them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\n","Y O U R  H A B I T S  C A N  C O M P O U N D  F O R  Y O U  O R  A G A I N S T  Y O U\n","P o s i t i v e  C o m p o u n d i n g\n","P r o d u c t i v i t y  c o m p o u n d s .

Furthermore, each book\n","you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways\n","of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge\n","works. It builds up, like compound interest.”\n","R e l a t i o n s h i p s  c o m p o u n d .  People reflect your behavior back to you. The more\n","you help others, the more others want to help you.

The more you think of yourself as worthless,\n","stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get\n","trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once\n","you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those\n","kind of people everywhere.\n","O u t r a g e  c o m p o u n d s .  Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result\n","of a single event. Instead, a long series of microaggressions and daily\n","aggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrage spreads\n","like wildfire.\n","WHA T PROGRESS IS REALL Y LIKE\n","Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. e\n","room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-\u0000ve degrees.\n","Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.\n","Twenty-six degrees.\n","Twenty-seven.\n","Twenty-eight.\n","e ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.\n","Twenty-nine degrees.\n","irty.\n","irty-one.\n","Still, nothing has happened.\n","en, thirty-two degrees. e ice begins to melt. A one-degree shi,\n","seemingly no diﬀerent from the temperature increases before it, has\n","unlocked a huge change.\n","Breakthrough moments are oen the result of many previous actions,\n","which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. is\n","pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life\n","undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be\n","seen for the \u0000rst \u0000ve years as it builds extensive root systems underground\n","before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.\n","Similarly, habits oen appear to make no diﬀerence until you cross a\n","critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and\n","middle stages of any quest, there is oen a Valley of Disappointment. You\n","expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating howineﬀective changes can seem during the \u0000rst days, weeks, and even months.\n","It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any\n","compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.\n","is is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last.\n","People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to\n","stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see\n","any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to\n","let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful\n","diﬀerence, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau\n","—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.\n","If you \u0000nd yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it\n","is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is oen because you\n","have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not\n","achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice\n","cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-\u0000ve to thirty-one degrees.\n","Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at\n","thirty-two degrees.\n","When you \u0000nally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people\n","will call it an overnight success. e outside world only sees the most\n","dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the\n","work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t making any\n","progress—that makes the jump today possible.\n","It is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic plates can\n","grind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly building\n","all the while. en, one day, they rub each other once again, in the same\n","fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An\n","earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it happens all at once.\n","Mastery requires patience. e San Antonio Spurs, one of the most\n","successful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer Jacob\n","Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and\n","look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times\n","without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and \u0000rst blow it\n","will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that\n","had gone before.”THE PLA TEAU OF LA TENT POTENTIAL\n","FIGURE 2: We often expect progress to be linear. At the very\n","least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our\n","efforts are often delayed. It is not until months or years later that\n","we realize the true value of the previous work we have done.\n","This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel\n","discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work\n","without experiencing any results. However, this work was not\n","wasted. It was simply being stored. It is not until much later that\n","the full value of previous efforts is revealed.\n","All big things come from small beginnings. e seed of every habit is a\n","single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and\n","grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. e task of\n","breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task\n","of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate \u0000ower one day at a time.\n","But what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to\n","survive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other side?\n","What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits and enables\n","others to enjoy the compounding eﬀects of good ones?FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD\n","Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life—\n","getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more and\n","worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to set\n","speci\u0000c, actionable goals.\n","For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one was\n","a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school, for\n","the weights I wanted to li in the gym, for the pro\u0000ts I wanted to earn in\n","business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually, I\n","began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and\n","nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.\n","What’s the diﬀerence between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I \u0000rst\n","learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert comic. Goals\n","are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes\n","that lead to those results.\n","If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your\n","system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches,\n","and conduct practice.\n","If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar\n","business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees,\n","and run marketing campaigns.\n","If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your\n","system is how oen you practice, how you break down and tackle\n","diﬃcult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your\n","instructor.\n","Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals\n","and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if\n","you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a\n","championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each\n","day, would you still get results?\n","I think you would.e goal in any sport is to \u0000nish with the best score, but it would be\n","ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. e only way\n","to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super\n","Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “e score takes care of itself.” e same is true for\n","other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals.\n","Focus on your system instead.\n","What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not.\n","Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making\n","progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time\n","thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.\n","Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.\n","Goal setting suﬀers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate\n","on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume\n","that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people\n","who had the same objective but didn’t succeed.\n","Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get\n","the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then\n","the goal cannot be what diﬀerentiates the winners from the losers. It wasn’t\n","the goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to\n","the top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year\n","before—just like every other professional team. e goal had always been\n","there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small\n","improvements that they achieved a diﬀerent outcome.\n","Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.\n","Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you\n","summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now.\n","But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy\n","room in the \u0000rst place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and\n","hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re le chasing the same\n","outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a\n","symptom without addressing the cause.Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. at’s the\n","counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our\n","results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change\n","are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the\n","results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good,\n","you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the\n","outputs will \u0000x themselves.\n","Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.\n","e implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then\n","I’ll be happy.” e problem with a goals-\u0000rst mentality is that you’re\n","continually putting happiness oﬀ until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into\n","this trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years, happiness was always\n","something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained\n","twenty pounds of muscle or aer my business was featured in the New York\n","Times, then I could \u0000nally relax.\n","Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” con\u0000ict: either you achieve your\n","goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You\n","mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. is is misguided.\n","It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey\n","you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your\n","satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.\n","A systems-\u0000rst mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love\n","with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give\n","yourself permission to be happy. You can be satis\u0000ed anytime your system is\n","running. And a system can be successful in many diﬀerent forms, not just\n","the one you \u0000rst envision.\n","Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.\n","Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” eﬀect. Many runners\n","work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the \u0000nish line, they stop\n","training. e race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your\n","hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is le to push you forwardaer you achieve it? is is why many people \u0000nd themselves reverting to\n","their old habits aer accomplishing a goal.\n","e purpose of setting goals is to win the game. e purpose of building\n","systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less\n","thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of\n","endless re\u0000nement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your\n","commitment to the process that will determine your progress.\n","A SYSTEM OF A T OMIC HABITS\n","If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. e\n","problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not\n","because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system\n","for change.\n","You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your\n","systems.\n","Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the\n","core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the\n","word atomic. By now, you’ve probably realized that an atomic habit refers to\n","a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But atomic habits\n","are not just any old habits, however small. ey are little habits that are part\n","of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic\n","habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\n","Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that\n","contributes to your overall improvement. At \u0000rst, these tiny routines seem\n","insigni\u0000cant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that\n","multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment.\n","ey are both small and mighty. is is the meaning of the phrase atomic\n","habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do,\n","but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of\n","compound growth.\n","Chapter SummaryHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement.

And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll\n","be doing the same thing rather than something better.\n","It oen feels diﬃcult to keep good habits going for more than a few days,\n","even with sincere eﬀort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like\n","exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two\n","and then become a hassle.\n","However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around\n","forever—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best intentions,\n","unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much television,\n","procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.\n","Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change\n","the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. In\n","this chapter, I’ll address the \u0000rst point. In the chapters that follow, I’ll answer\n","the second.\n","Our \u0000rst mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To understand\n","what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which change can occur.\n","You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.THREE LA YERS OF BEHA VIOR CHANGE\n","FIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change\n","in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in\n","your identity.\n","e \u0000rst layer is changing your outcomes. is level is concerned with\n","changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a\n","championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of\n","change.\n","e second layer is changing your process. is level is concerned with\n","changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym,\n","decluttering your desk for better work\u0000ow, developing a meditation practice.\n","Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.\n","e third and deepest layer is changing your identity. is level is\n","concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your\n","judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and\n","biases you hold are associated with this level.\n","Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do.\n","Identity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habits that last\n","—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent improvements—theproblem is not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another. All levels of\n","change are useful in their own way. e problem is the direction of change.\n","Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on\n","what they want to achieve. is leads us to outcome-based habits. e\n","alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by\n","focusing on who we wish to become.\n","OUTCOME-BASED HABITS\n","IDENTITY -BASED HABITS\n","FIGURE 4: With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you\n","want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who\n","you wish to become.Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When oﬀered a smoke, the \u0000rst\n","person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable\n","response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be\n","something else. ey are hoping their behavior will change while carrying\n","around the same beliefs.\n","e second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s\n","a small diﬀerence, but this statement signals a shi in identity. Smoking was\n","part of their former life, not their current one. ey no longer identify as\n","someone who smokes.\n","Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to\n","improve. ey just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this\n","diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” ey set goals and determine the actions\n","they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that\n","drive their actions. ey never shi the way they look at themselves, and\n","they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for\n","change.\n","Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. e system of a\n","democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social\n","equality. e system of a dictatorship has a very diﬀerent set of beliefs like\n","absolute authority and strict obedience. You can imagine many ways to try\n","to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such behavior change would\n","never get oﬀ the ground in a dictatorship. at’s not the identity of the\n","system. Voting is a behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.\n","A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals,\n","organizations, or societies. ere are a set of beliefs and assumptions that\n","shape the system, an identity behind the habits.\n","Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want\n","more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than\n","creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than\n","earning. You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize\n","comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than\n","training. It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying\n","beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan,\n","but you haven’t changed who you are.\n","e story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado,\n","provides a good example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed my\u0000ngernails,” Clark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I was young,\n","and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day, I resolved\n","to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit. rough mindful\n","willpower alone, I managed to do it.”\n","en, Clark did something surprising.\n","“I asked my wife to schedule my \u0000rst-ever manicure,” he said. “My\n","thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t chew\n","them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was\n","the manicure made my \u0000ngers look really nice for the \u0000rst time. e\n","manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had really healthy,\n","attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my \u0000ngernails. And even though\n","that’s something I had never aspired to, it made all the diﬀerence. I’ve never\n","chewed my nails since; not even a single close call. And it’s because I now\n","take pride in properly caring for them.”\n","e ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of\n","your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s\n","something very diﬀerent to say I’m the type of person who is this.\n","e more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more\n","motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re\n","proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for\n","and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure\n","you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you\n","knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your\n","pride gets involved, you’ll \u0000ght tooth and nail to maintain your habits.\n","True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because\n","of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes\n","part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat\n","healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shi the belief behind the behavior,\n","then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only\n","temporary until they become part of who you are.\n","e goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.\n","e goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.\n","e goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.Your behaviors are usually a re\u0000ection of your identity. What you do is an\n","indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously\n","or nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a person believes in a\n","particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment\n","with that belief. For example, people who identi\u0000ed as “being a voter” were\n","more likely to vote than those who simply claimed “voting” was an action\n","they wanted to perform. Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into\n","their identity doesn’t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right\n","thing is easy. Aer all, when your behavior and your identity are fully\n","aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting\n","like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.\n","Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword.\n","When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-\n","improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a\n","curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your\n","allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people walk through life\n","in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their\n","identity.\n","“I’m terrible with directions.”\n","“I’m not a morning person.”\n","“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”\n","“I’m always late.”\n","“I’m not good with technology.”\n","“I’m horrible at math.”\n",". . . and a thousand other variations.\n","When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide\n","into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to\n","resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” ere is internal pressure\n","to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your\n","beliefs. You \u0000nd whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.\n","e more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more\n","diﬃcult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture\n","believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personalidentity), even if it’s wrong. e biggest barrier to positive change at any\n","level—individual, team, society—is identity con\u0000ict. Good habits can make\n","rational sense, but if they con\u0000ict with your identity, you will fail to put\n","them into action.\n","On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too\n","busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over\n","the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that\n","your self-image gets in the way. is is why you can’t get too attached to one\n","version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best\n","version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to\n","upgrade and expand your identity.\n","is brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and worldview\n","play such an important role in your behavior, where do they come from in\n","the \u0000rst place? How, exactly, is your identity formed? And how can you\n","emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and gradually erase\n","the pieces that hinder you?\n","THE TWO-STEP PROCESS T O CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY\n","Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset\n","beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and\n","conditioned through experience.*\n","More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you\n","make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person.\n","When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person.\n","When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.\n","e more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity\n","associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally\n","derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem,\n","which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”\n","Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have\n","proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you have\n","evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour every\n","night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym evenwhen it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to \u0000tness. e\n","more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.\n","For most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a writer. If you were to\n","ask any of my high school teachers or college professors, they would tell you\n","I was an average writer at best: certainly not a standout. When I began my\n","writing career, I published a new article every Monday and ursday for the\n","\u0000rst few years. As the evidence grew, so did my identity as a writer. I didn’t\n","start out as a writer. I became one through my habits.\n","Of course, your habits are not the only actions that in\u0000uence your\n","identity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important\n","ones. Each experience in life modi\u0000es your self-image, but it’s unlikely you\n","would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an\n","artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however,\n","the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change. e eﬀect of\n","one-oﬀ experiences tends to fade away while the eﬀect of habits gets\n","reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the\n","evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits\n","is actually the process of becoming yourself.\n","is is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our \u0000ngers\n","and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day,\n","habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.\n","Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you\n","\u0000nish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If\n","you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes\n","exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are the type of\n","person who likes music.\n","Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\n","No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so\n","does the evidence of your new identity. is is one reason why meaningful\n","change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful\n","diﬀerence by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is\n","meaningful, it actually is big. at’s the paradox of making small\n","improvements.\n","Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing\n","your identity. e most practical way to change who you are is to change\n","what you do.Each time you write a page, you are a writer.\n","Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.\n","Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.\n","Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.\n","Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more\n","important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish\n","these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change,\n","the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.\n","Of course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to\n","perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. e good news is that you\n","don’t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be votes for both\n","sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a\n","majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an\n","unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.\n","New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes\n","you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If\n","nothing changes, nothing is going to change.\n","It is a simple two-step process:\n","1. Decide the type of person you want to be.\n","2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\n","First, decide who you want to be. is holds at any level—as an\n","individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to\n","stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to\n","become?\n","ese are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to begin—but\n","they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack abs or to feel\n","less anxious or to double their salary. at’s \u0000ne. Start there and work\n","backward from the results you want to the type of person who could get\n","those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the\n","outcome I want?” Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds?\n","Who is the type of person that could learn a new language? Who is the type\n","of person that could run a successful start-up?For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s\n","probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shis\n","from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is\n","consistent and reliable (identity-based).\n","is process can lead to beliefs like:\n","“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.”\n","“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy\n","they need.”\n","“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”\n","Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can\n","begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a friend\n","who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person\n","do?” All day long, she would use this question as a guide. Would a healthy\n","person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a\n","salad? She \u0000gured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually\n","she would become that person. She was right.\n","e concept of identity-based habits is our \u0000rst introduction to another\n","key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and\n","your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. e formation of all\n","habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next\n","chapter), but it’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive\n","the loop rather than your results. e focus should always be on becoming\n","that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.\n","THE REAL REASON HABITS MA TTER\n","Identity change is the North Star of habit change. e remainder of this\n","book will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to build better\n","habits in yourself, your family, your team, your company, and anywhere else\n","you wish. But the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of person you\n","want to become?” e \u0000rst step is not what or how, but who. You need to\n","know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat\n","without a rudder. And that’s why we are starting here.You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is\n","not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the\n","identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And\n","this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits\n","matter.\n","Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not\n","about \u0000ossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or\n","wearing the same out\u0000t each day. It’s not about achieving external measures\n","of success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits\n","can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not\n","about having something. ey are about becoming someone.\n","Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of\n","person you wish to be. ey are the channel through which you develop\n","your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.\n","Chapter Summary\n","ere are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and\n","identity change.\n","e most eﬀective way to change your habits is to focus not on what\n","you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.\n","Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the\n","type of person you wish to become.\n","Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit\n","your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\n","e real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better\n","results (although they can do that), but because they can change your\n","beliefs about yourself.I\n","3\n","How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple\n","Steps\n","N 1898, A psychologist named Edward orndike conducted an experiment\n","that would lay the foundation for our understanding of how habits form\n","and the rules that guide our behavior. orndike was interested in studying\n","the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats.\n","He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. e box\n","was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “by some simple\n","act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a\n","platform.” For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed, would\n","open a door on the side of the box. Once the door had been opened, the cat\n","could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.\n","Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box.\n","ey would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through\n","openings, and claw at loose objects. Aer a few minutes of exploration, the\n","cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door would open, and they\n","would escape.\n","orndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In the\n","beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as soon as the\n","lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began.\n","Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with\n","the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food.Aer twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and\n","habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example,\n","orndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act. 160\n","seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14,\n","10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”\n","During the \u0000rst three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes.\n","During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. With\n","practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and\n","more automatic. Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut\n","straight to the solution.\n","From his studies, orndike described the learning process by stating,\n","“behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and\n","those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”\n","His work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form\n","in our own lives. It also provides answers to some fundamental questions\n","like: What are habits? And why does the brain bother building them at all?\n","WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS\n","A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become\n","automatic. e process of habit formation begins with trial and error.\n","Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a\n","decision. How do I respond to this? e \u0000rst time you come across a problem,\n","you’re not sure how to solve it. Like orndike’s cat, you’re just trying things\n","out to see what works.\n","Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are\n","carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how\n","to act. You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of\n","it all. e brain is busy learning the most eﬀective course of action.\n","Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution.\n","You’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run calms you\n","down. You’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and you learn\n","that playing video games relaxes you. You’re exploring, exploring, exploring,\n","and then—BAM—a reward.Aer you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy\n","for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that\n","preceded the reward. Wait a minute—that felt good. What did I do right\n","before that?\n","is is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try\n","diﬀerently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful\n","actions get reinforced. at’s a habit forming.\n","Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate\n","the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions\n","that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly. As behavioral\n","scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to\n","recurring problems in our environment.”\n","As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn\n","to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else.\n","When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look\n","for. ere is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your\n","brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this,\n","then that. ese cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever\n","the situation is appropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the\n","itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video\n","game controller. A choice that once required eﬀort is now automatic. A habit\n","has been created.\n","Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is\n","just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the\n","past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and\n","automatically apply the same solution. e primary reason the brain\n","remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.\n","Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the\n","bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time.\n","As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious\n","attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the\n","conscious mind likes to pawn oﬀ tasks to the nonconscious mind to do\n","automatically. is is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits\n","reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your\n","attention to other tasks.Despite their eﬃciency, some people still wonder about the bene\u0000ts of\n","habits. e argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull? I don’t\n","want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy. Doesn’t so much\n","routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?” Hardly. Such\n","questions set up a false dichotomy. ey make you think that you have to\n","choose between building habits and attaining freedom. In reality, the two\n","complement each other.\n","Habits do not restrict freedom. ey create it. In fact, the people who\n","don’t have their habits handled are oen the ones with the least amount of\n","freedom. Without good \u0000nancial habits, you will always be struggling for the\n","next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on\n","energy. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind\n","the curve. If you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks\n","—when should I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—\n","then you have less time for freedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of\n","life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and\n","creativity.\n","Conversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are\n","handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master\n","the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to do\n","more of what you want in the future.\n","THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK\n","e process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue,\n","craving, response, and reward.* Breaking it down into these fundamental\n","parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to\n","improve it.FIGURE 5: All habits proceed through four stages in the same\n","order: cue, craving, response, and reward.\n","is four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain runs\n","through these steps in the same order each time.\n","First, there is the cue. e cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It\n","is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were\n","paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like\n","food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that\n","predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise\n","and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of\n","course, these pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and\n","reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)\n","Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external\n","environment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is the\n","\u0000rst indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.\n","Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind\n","every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a\n","change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but\n","the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you\n","crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your\n","teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on\n","the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire\n","to change your internal state. is is an important point that we will discuss\n","in detail later.\n","Cravings diﬀer from person to person. In theory, any piece of\n","information could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not\n","motivated by the same cues. For a gambler, the sound of slot machines can\n","be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For someone whorarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background\n","noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. e thoughts,\n","feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a\n","craving.\n","e third step is the response. e response is the actual habit you\n","perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a\n","response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction\n","is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical\n","or mental eﬀort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it. Your\n","response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can\n","occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball but\n","can’t jump high enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck.\n","Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every\n","habit. e cue is about noticing the reward. e craving is about wanting the\n","reward. e response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards\n","because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.\n","e \u0000rst purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards\n","provide bene\u0000ts on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you need\n","to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect. Getting in\n","shape improves your health and your dating prospects. But the more\n","immediate bene\u0000t is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat or to gain status\n","or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewards deliver contentment and\n","relief from craving.\n","Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the\n","future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your\n","sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy\n","your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment\n","are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful\n","actions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the\n","habit cycle.\n","If a behavior is insuﬃcient in any of the four stages, it will not become a\n","habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving\n","and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior\n","diﬃcult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your\n","desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the\u0000rst three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will\n","not be repeated.\n","THE HABIT LOOP\n","FIGURE 6: The four stages of habit are best described as a\n","feedback loop. They form an endless cycle that is running every\n","moment you are alive. This “habit loop” is continually scanning\n","the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out\n","different responses, and learning from the results.*\n","In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response,\n","which provides a reward, which satis\u0000es the craving and, ultimately,\n","becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a\n","neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving,\n","response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. is\n","cycle is known as the habit loop.is four-step process is not something that happens occasionally, but\n","rather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active during every\n","moment you are alive—even now. e brain is continually scanning the\n","environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out diﬀerent\n","responses, and learning from the results. e entire process is completed in\n","a split second, and we use it again and again without realizing everything\n","that has been packed into the previous moment.\n","We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the\n","solution phase. e problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is\n","when you realize that something needs to change. e solution phase\n","includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and\n","achieve the change you desire.\n","P r o b l e m  p h a s e\n","1 .

Sometimes the\n","problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it.\n","Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to\n","relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you\n","face.\n","In the table on the following page, you can see a few examples of what\n","this looks like in real life.\n","Imagine walking into a dark room and \u0000ipping on the light switch. You\n","have performed this simple habit so many times that it occurs without\n","thinking. You proceed through all four stages in the fraction of a second.\n","e urge to act strikes you without thinking.\n","P r o b l e m  p h a s e\n","1 .

Turning on the light switch becomes\n","associated with being in a dark room.\n","By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are\n","running our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the fact that we\n","tie the same shoe \u0000rst each morning, or unplug the toaster aer each use, or\n","always change into comfortable clothes aer getting home from work. Aer\n","decades of mental programming, we automatically slip into these patterns of\n","thinking and acting.\n","THE FOUR LA WS OF BEHA VIOR CHANGE\n","In the following chapters, we will see time and again how the four stages of\n","cue, craving, response, and reward in\u0000uence nearly everything we do each\n","day. But before we do that, we need to transform these four steps into a\n","practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad\n","ones.\n","I refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and it\n","provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad\n","ones. You can think of each law as a lever that in\u0000uences human behavior.When the levers are in the right positions, creating good habits is eﬀortless.\n","When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.\n","H o w  t o  C r e a t e  a  G o o d  H a b i t\n","T h e  1 s t  l a w  ( C u e ) : Make it obvious.\n","T h e  2 n d  l a w  ( C r a v i n g ) : Make it attractive.\n","T h e  3 r d  l a w  ( R e s p o n s e ) : Make it easy.\n","T h e  4 t h  l a w  ( R e w a r d ) : Make it satisfying.\n","We can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.\n","H o w  t o  B r e a k  a  B a d  H a b i t\n","I n v e r s i o n  o f  t h e  1 s t  l a w  ( C u e ) : Make it invisible.\n","I n v e r s i o n  o f  t h e  2 n d  l a w  ( C r a v i n g ) : Make it unattractive.\n","I n v e r s i o n  o f  t h e  3 r d  l a w  ( R e s p o n s e ) : Make it difficult.\n","I n v e r s i o n  o f  t h e  4 t h  l a w  ( R e w a r d ) : Make it unsatisfying.\n","It would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four laws are an\n","exhaustive framework for changing any human behavior, but I think they’re\n","close. As you will soon see, the Four Laws of Behavior Change apply to\n","nearly every \u0000eld, from sports to politics, art to medicine, comedy to\n","management. ese laws can be used no matter what challenge you are\n","facing. ere is no need for completely diﬀerent strategies for each habit.\n","Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask\n","yourself:\n","1. How can I make it obvious?\n","2. How can I make it attractive?\n","3. How can I make it easy?\n","4. How can I make it satisfying?\n","If you have ever wondered, “Why don’t I do what I say I’m going to do?\n","Why don’t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirement or start\n","that side business? Why do I say something is important but never seem tomake time for it?” e answers to those questions can be found somewhere\n","in these four laws. e key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is\n","to understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your\n","speci\u0000cations. Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of\n","human nature.\n","Your habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chapters that\n","follow, we will discuss these laws one by one and show how you can use\n","them to create a system in which good habits emerge naturally and bad\n","habits wither away.\n","Chapter Summary\n","A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become\n","automatic.\n","e ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as\n","little energy and eﬀort as possible.\n","Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four\n","steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.\n","e Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use\n","to build better habits. ey are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it\n","attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.THE 1ST LA W\n","Make It Obvious4\n","The Man Who Didn’t Look Right\n","THE PSYCHOLOGIST GARY Klein once told me a story about a woman who\n","attended a family gathering. She had spent years working as a paramedic\n","and, upon arriving at the event, took one look at her father-in-law and got\n","very concerned.\n","“I don’t like the way you look,” she said.\n","Her father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly \u0000ne, jokingly replied, “Well,\n","I don’t like your looks, either.”\n","“No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.”\n","A few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery aer an\n","examination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery and was\n","at immediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in-law’s intuition,\n","he could have died.\n","What did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending heart\n","attack?\n","When major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending blood\n","to critical organs and away from peripheral locations near the surface of the\n","skin. e result is a change in the pattern of distribution of blood in the face.\n","Aer many years of working with people with heart failure, the woman had\n","unknowingly developed the ability to recognize this pattern on sight. She\n","couldn’t explain what it was that she noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but\n","she knew something was wrong.Similar stories exist in other \u0000elds. For example, military analysts can\n","identify which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile and which one is a\n","plane from their own \u0000eet even though they are traveling at the same speed,\n","\u0000ying at the same altitude, and look identical on radar in nearly every\n","respect. During the Gulf War, Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved\n","an entire battleship when he ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact\n","that it looked exactly like the battleship’s own planes on radar. He made the\n","right call, but even his superior oﬃcers couldn’t explain how he did it.\n","Museum curators have been known to discern the diﬀerence between an\n","authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit even though\n","they can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them oﬀ. Experienced\n","radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area where a stroke will\n","develop before any obvious signs are visible to the untrained eye. I’ve even\n","heard of hairdressers noticing whether a client is pregnant based only on the\n","feel of her hair.\n","e human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in\n","your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.\n","Whenever you experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing\n","the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a\n","radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through\n","the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that\n","information for future use.\n","With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain\n","outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain\n","encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t always explain\n","what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and\n","your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation\n","for every habit you have.\n","We underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without\n","thinking. You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your lungs\n","to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles all this and\n","more on autopilot. You are much more than your conscious self.\n","Consider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t\n","necessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time to eat.\n","Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body has a variety\n","of feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time to eat again andthat track what is going on around you and within you. Cravings can arise\n","thanks to hormones and chemicals circulating through your body. Suddenly,\n","you’re hungry even though you’re not quite sure what tipped you oﬀ.\n","is is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t\n","need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an\n","opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it.\n","is is what makes habits useful.\n","It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come\n","under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into\n","old patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless someone points it\n","out, you may not notice that you cover your mouth with your hand\n","whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking a question, or that you\n","have a habit of \u0000nishing other people’s sentences. And the more you repeat\n","these patterns, the less likely you become to question what you’re doing and\n","why you’re doing it.\n","I once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty gi\n","cards aer customers had used up the balance on the card. One day, the\n","clerk cashed out a few customers in a row who purchased with gi cards.\n","When the next person walked up, the clerk swiped the customer’s actual\n","credit card, picked up the scissors, and then cut it in half—entirely on\n","autopilot—before looking up at the stunned customer and realizing what\n","had just happened.\n","Another woman I came across in my research was a former preschool\n","teacher who had switched to a corporate job. Even though she was now\n","working with adults, her old habits would kick in and she kept asking\n","coworkers if they had washed their hands aer going to the bathroom. I also\n","found the story of a man who had spent years working as a lifeguard and\n","would occasionally yell “Walk!” whenever he saw a child running.\n","Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they\n","are essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the remote control\n","next to the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our responses to these cues are\n","so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere.\n","For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with\n","awareness.\n","Before we can eﬀectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our\n","current ones. is can be more challenging than it sounds because once ahabit is \u0000rmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If\n","a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist\n","Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct\n","your life and you will call it fate.”\n","THE HABITS SCORECARD\n","e Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world. If\n","you ever \u0000nd yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice that the\n","conductors have a peculiar habit.\n","As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing\n","at diﬀerent objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches a\n","signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is green.” As the train\n","pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer\n","and call out the exact speed. When it’s time to leave, the operator will point\n","at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are\n","performing similar actions. Before each train departs, staﬀ members will\n","point along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is\n","identi\u0000ed, pointed at, and named aloud.*\n","is process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed\n","to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-\n","Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent.\n","e MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modi\u0000ed version that\n","is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of\n","incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.”\n","Pointing-and-Calling is so eﬀective because it raises the level of\n","awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the\n","train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more\n","likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.\n","My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out\n","the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her\n","packing list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got\n","my husband.”\n","e more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to\n","consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousandtimes before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will\n","be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we\n","don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our\n","failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.\n","One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining\n","awareness of what we are actually doing. is helps explain why the\n","consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call”\n","system for our personal lives. at’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard,\n","which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your\n","behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.\n","Here’s a sample of where your list might start:\n","Wake up\n","Turn oﬀ alarm\n","Check my phone\n","Go to the bathroom\n","Weigh myself\n","Take a shower\n","Brush my teeth\n","Floss my teeth\n","Put on deodorant\n","Hang up towel to dry\n","Get dressed\n","Make a cup of tea\n",". . . and so on.\n","Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a\n","good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+”\n","next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.\n","For example, the list above might look like this:\n","Wake up =\n","Turn oﬀ alarm =\n","Check my phone –\n","Go to the bathroom =Weigh myself +\n","Take a shower +\n","Brush my teeth +\n","Floss my teeth +\n","Put on deodorant +\n","Hang up towel to dry =\n","Get dressed =\n","Make a cup of tea +\n","e marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation\n","and your goals. For someone who is trying to lose weight, eating a bagel\n","with peanut butter every morning might be a bad habit. For someone who is\n","trying to bulk up and add muscle, the same behavior might be a good habit.\n","It all depends on what you’re working toward.*\n","Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason as well.\n","e labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. ere are no\n","good habits or bad habits. ere are only eﬀective habits. at is, eﬀective at\n","solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—\n","which is why you repeat them. For this exercise, categorize your habits by\n","how they will bene\u0000t you in the long run. Generally speaking, good habits\n","will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes.\n","Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you),\n","but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior.\n","If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit,\n","here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me become the type\n","of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired\n","identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good.\n","Habits that con\u0000ict with your desired identity are usually bad.\n","As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything\n","at \u0000rst. e goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. Observe your\n","thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism. Don’t blame\n","yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes.\n","If you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as if you\n","were watching someone else. Oh, how interesting that they would do such a\n","thing. If you binge-eat, simply notice that you are eating more calories thanyou should. If you waste time online, notice that you are spending your life\n","in a way that you do not want to.\n","e \u0000rst step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If\n","you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in\n","your own life. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and\n","what the outcome will be. If you want to cut back on your junk food habit\n","but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat\n","this cookie, but I don’t need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and\n","hurt my health.”\n","Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem\n","more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly\n","slip into an old routine. is approach is useful even if you’re simply trying\n","to remember a task on your to-do list. Just saying out loud, “Tomorrow, I\n","need to go to the post oﬃce aer lunch,” increases the odds that you’ll\n","actually do it. You’re getting yourself to acknowledge the need for action—\n","and that can make all the diﬀerence.\n","e process of behavior change always starts with awareness. Strategies\n","like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are focused on getting\n","you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them,\n","which makes it possible to respond in a way that bene\u0000ts you.\n","Chapter Summary\n","With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict\n","certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.\n","Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what\n","we are doing.\n","e process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need\n","to be aware of your habits before you can change them.\n","Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a\n","nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your\n","actions.\n","e Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more\n","aware of your behavior.I\n","5\n","The Best Way to Start a New Habit\n","N 2001, RESEARCHERS in Great Britain began working with 248 people to\n","build better exercise habits over the course of two weeks. e subjects\n","were divided into three groups.\n","e \u0000rst group was the control group. ey were simply asked to track\n","how oen they exercised.\n","e second group was the “motivation” group. ey were asked not only\n","to track their workouts but also to read some material on the bene\u0000ts of\n","exercise. e researchers also explained to the group how exercise could\n","reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve heart health.\n","Finally, there was the third group. ese subjects received the same\n","presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels\n","of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan for when\n","and where they would exercise over the following week. Speci\u0000cally, each\n","member of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the\n","next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on\n","[DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”\n","In the \u0000rst and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at\n","least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to\n","the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But\n","91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than\n","double the normal rate.e sentence they \u0000lled out is what researchers refer to as an\n","implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when\n","and where to act. at is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.\n","e cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel\n","of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies,\n","the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are time\n","and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.\n","Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation\n","intention is:\n","“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”\n","Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are\n","eﬀective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact time\n","and date of when you will get a \u0000u shot or recording the time of your\n","colonoscopy appointment. ey increase the odds that people will stick with\n","habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early, and stopping smoking.\n","Researchers have even found that voter turnout increases when people\n","are forced to create implementation intentions by answering questions like:\n","“What route are you taking to the polling station? At what time are you\n","planning to go? What bus will get you there?” Other successful government\n","programs have prompted citizens to make a clear plan to send taxes in on\n","time or provided directions on when and where to pay late traﬃc bills.\n","e punch line is clear: people who make a speci\u0000c plan for when and\n","where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. Too\n","many people try to change their habits without these basic details \u0000gured\n","out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write\n","more,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen.\n","We leave it up to chance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or\n","feel motivated at the right time. An implementation intention sweeps away\n","foggy notions like “I want to work out more” or “I want to be more\n","productive” or “I should vote” and transforms them into a concrete plan of\n","action.\n","Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is\n","clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some peoplespend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an\n","improvement.\n","Once an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to wait\n","for inspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I meditate this\n","morning or at lunch? When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to\n","make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.\n","e simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to \u0000ll out\n","this sentence:\n","I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].\n","Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.\n","Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my\n","bedroom.\n","Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.\n","Marriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the kitchen.\n","If you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the \u0000rst day of the week,\n","month, or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because\n","hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A\n","fresh start feels motivating.\n","ere is another bene\u0000t to implementation intentions. Being speci\u0000c\n","about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things\n","that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you oﬀ course. We\n","oen say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what\n","we need to be doing instead. When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to\n","rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the speci\u0000c\n","things you need to do to succeed.\n","Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. e goal is to\n","make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get\n","an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. As\n","the writer Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to just work out\n","without conscious thought. But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you\n","start to get antsy around the time of day you normally work out.”ere are many ways to use implementation intentions in your life and\n","work. My favorite approach is one I learned from Stanford professor BJ Fogg\n","and it is a strategy I refer to as habit stacking.\n","HABIT ST ACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN T O OVERHAUL YOUR\n","HABITS\n","e French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in poverty,\n","but that all changed one day in 1765.\n","Diderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could not aﬀord to\n","pay for the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well known for\n","his role as the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, one of the most\n","comprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine the Great, the\n","Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s \u0000nancial troubles, her heart went out\n","to him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed his encyclopedia. She\n","oﬀered to buy Diderot’s personal library for £1,000—more than $150,000\n","today.* Suddenly, Diderot had money to spare. With his new wealth, he not\n","only paid for the wedding but also acquired a scarlet robe for himself.\n","Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he\n","immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his\n","more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more coordination,\n","no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his\n","stuﬀ.\n","Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his rug\n","with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures.\n","He bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He\n","tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like falling dominoes, one\n","purchase led to the next.\n","Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one\n","purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Eﬀect. e Diderot\n","Eﬀect states that obtaining a new possession oen creates a spiral of\n","consumption that leads to additional purchases.\n","You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to get\n","new shoes and earrings to match. You buy a couch and suddenly question\n","the layout of your entire living room. You buy a toy for your child and soon\u0000nd yourself purchasing all of the accessories that go with it. It’s a chain\n","reaction of purchases.\n","Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You oen decide what to do\n","next based on what you have just \u0000nished doing. Going to the bathroom\n","leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you that you need\n","to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry detergent to the\n","shopping list, and so on. No behavior happens in isolation. Each action\n","becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.\n","Why is this important?\n","When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of\n","behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to\n","identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new\n","behavior on top. is is called habit stacking.\n","Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather\n","than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it\n","with a current habit. is method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of\n","his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly\n","any habit.*\n","e habit stacking formula is:\n","“Aer [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\n","For example:\n","Meditation. Aer I pour my cup of coﬀee each morning, I will meditate\n","for one minute.\n","Exercise. Aer I take oﬀ my work shoes, I will immediately change into\n","my workout clothes.\n","Gratitude. Aer I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m grateful\n","for that happened today.\n","Marriage. Aer I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss.\n","Safety. Aer I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family\n","member where I am running and how long it will take.e key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do\n","each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to\n","create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. is allows you to take\n","advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading\n","into the next—a positive version of the Diderot Eﬀect.\n","HABIT ST ACKING\n","FIGURE 7: Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll\n","stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old\n","one. This process can be repeated to chain numerous habits\n","together, each one acting as the cue for the next.Your morning routine habit stack might look like this:\n","1. Aer I pour my morning cup of coﬀee, I will meditate for sixty\n","seconds.\n","2. Aer I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day.\n","3. Aer I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my\n","\u0000rst task.\n","Or, consider this habit stack in the evening:\n","1. Aer I \u0000nish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the\n","dishwasher.\n","2. Aer I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the counter.\n","3. Aer I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coﬀee mug for\n","tomorrow morning.\n","You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current\n","routines. For example, you may already have a morning routine that looks\n","like this: Wake up > Make my bed > Take a shower. Let’s say you want to\n","develop the habit of reading more each night. You can expand your habit\n","stack and try something like: Wake up > Make my bed > Place a book on my\n","pillow > Take a shower. Now, when you climb into bed each night, a book\n","will be sitting there waiting for you to enjoy.\n","Overall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that\n","guide your future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan for which\n","action should come next. Once you get comfortable with this approach, you\n","can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is\n","appropriate:\n","Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using the\n","elevator.\n","Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to\n","someone I don’t know yet.Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-\n","four hours before purchasing.\n","Healthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies on\n","my plate \u0000rst.\n","Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away. (“One\n","in, one out.”)\n","Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile\n","before answering.\n","Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table and\n","chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.\n","No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful\n","habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things oﬀ. Unlike an\n","implementation intention, which speci\u0000cally states the time and location for\n","a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built\n","into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine\n","can make a big diﬀerence. If you’re trying to add meditation into your\n","morning routine but mornings are chaotic and your kids keep running into\n","the room, then that may be the wrong place and time. Consider when you\n","are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re\n","likely to be occupied with something else.\n","Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit. If\n","you want to do a habit every day, but you stack it on top of a habit that only\n","happens on Mondays, that’s not a good choice.\n","One way to \u0000nd the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming\n","a list of your current habits. You can use your Habits Scorecard from the last\n","chapter as a starting point. Alternatively, you can create a list with two\n","columns. In the \u0000rst column, write down the habits you do each day without\n","fail.*\n","For example:\n","Get out of bed.\n","Take a shower.\n","Brush your teeth.\n","Get dressed.Brew a cup of coﬀee.\n","Eat breakfast.\n","Take the kids to school.\n","Start the work day.\n","Eat lunch.\n","End the work day.\n","Change out of work clothes.\n","Sit down for dinner.\n","Turn oﬀ the lights.\n","Get into bed.\n","Your list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the second column,\n","write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail. For\n","example:\n","e sun rises.\n","You get a text message.\n","e song you are listening to ends.\n","e sun sets.\n","Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best place to\n","layer your new habit into your lifestyle.\n","Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly speci\u0000c and\n","immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. I made\n","this mistake myself.

She believed she could improve the\n","eating habits of thousands of hospital staﬀ and visitors without changing\n","their willpower or motivation in the slightest way. In fact, she didn’t plan on\n","talking to them at all.\n","orndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter the\n","“choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria. ey started by changing how\n","drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the refrigerators located next\n","to the cash registers in the cafeteria were \u0000lled with only soda. e\n","researchers added water as an option to each one. Additionally, they placed\n","baskets of bottled water next to the food stations throughout the room. Soda\n","was still in the primary refrigerators, but water was now available at all drink\n","locations.\n","Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital\n","dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increased by 25.8\n","percent. ey made similar adjustments—and saw similar results—with the\n","food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating there.\n","BEFOREFIGURE 8: Here is a representation of what the cafeteria looked\n","like before the environment design changes were made (left)\n","and after (right). The shaded boxes indicate areas where bottled\n","water was available in each instance. Because the amount of\n","water in the environment was increased, behavior shifted\n","naturally and without additional motivation.\n","People oen choose products not because of what they are, but because\n","of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the\n","counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been\n","thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry. If the\n","communal table at the oﬃce is always \u0000lled with doughnuts and bagels, it’s\n","going to be hard not to grab one every now and then. Your habits change\n","depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you.\n","Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite\n","our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again\n","under certain environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in\n","whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, themost common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed\n","by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.\n","In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a\n","powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their\n","Environment, or B = f (P,E).\n","It didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business. In 1952,\n","the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion\n","Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the\n","\u0000rst time and visualizes a need for it.” In other words, customers will\n","occasionally buy products not because they want them but because of how\n","they are presented to them.\n","For example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than those\n","down near the \u0000oor. For this reason, you’ll \u0000nd expensive brand names\n","featured in easy-to-reach locations on store shelves because they drive the\n","most pro\u0000t, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away in harder-to-reach\n","spots. e same goes for end caps, which are the units at the end of aisles.\n","End caps are moneymaking machines for retailers because they are obvious\n","locations that encounter a lot of foot traﬃc. For example, 45 percent of\n","Coca-Cola sales come speci\u0000cally from end-of-the-aisle racks.\n","e more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you\n","are to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and visit\n","Starbucks because it is on every corner. We like to think that we are in\n","control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted to\n","do so. e truth, however, is that many of the actions we take each day are\n","shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.\n","Every living being has its own methods for sensing and understanding\n","the world. Eagles have remarkable long-distance vision. Snakes can smell by\n","“tasting the air” with their highly sensitive tongues. Sharks can detect small\n","amounts of electricity and vibrations in the water caused by nearby \u0000sh.\n","Even bacteria have chemoreceptors—tiny sensory cells that allow them to\n","detect toxic chemicals in their environment.\n","In humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system. We\n","perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. But we also\n","have other ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious, but many are\n","nonconscious. For instance, you can “notice” when the temperature drops\n","before a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a stomachache, orwhen you fall oﬀ balance while walking on rocky ground. Receptors in your\n","body pick up on a wide range of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt\n","in your blood or the need to drink when thirsty.\n","e most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. e\n","human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten\n","million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the\n","brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that we are more dependent on\n","vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues\n","are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in\n","what you see can lead to a big shi in what you do. As a result, you can\n","imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are \u0000lled\n","with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.\n","ankfully, there is good news in this respect. You don’t have to be the\n","victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.\n","HOW T O DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS\n","During the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutch researchers\n","began to pay close attention to the country’s energy usage. In one suburb\n","near Amsterdam, they found that some homeowners used 30 percent less\n","energy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of similar size and\n","getting electricity for the same price.\n","It turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical\n","except for one feature: the location of the electrical meter. Some had one in\n","the basement. Others had the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway.\n","As you may guess, the homes with the meters located in the main hallway\n","used less electricity. When their energy use was obvious and easy to track,\n","people changed their behavior.\n","Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues\n","that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live and work\n","oen make it easy not to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue\n","to trigger the behavior. It’s easy not to practice the guitar when it’s tucked\n","away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a book when the bookshelf is in the\n","corner of the guest room. It’s easy not to take your vitamins when they areout of sight in the pantry. When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or\n","hidden, they are easy to ignore.\n","By comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention\n","toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staﬀ at Schiphol\n","Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like a \u0000y near the\n","center of each urinal. Apparently, when men stepped up to the urinals, they\n","aimed for what they thought was a bug. e stickers improved their aim and\n","signi\u0000cantly reduced “spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis\n","determined that the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per\n","year.\n","I’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. I used to buy\n","apples from the store, put them in the crisper in the bottom of the\n","refrigerator, and forget all about them. By the time I remembered, the apples\n","would have gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.\n","Eventually, I took my own advice and redesigned my environment. I\n","bought a large display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchen\n","counter. e next time I bought apples, that was where they went—out in\n","the open where I could see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a few\n","apples each day simply because they were obvious rather than out of sight.\n","Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the\n","cues for your preferred habits more obvious:\n","If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your\n","pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter.\n","If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand\n","in the middle of the living room.\n","If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of\n","stationery on your desk.\n","If you want to drink more water, \u0000ll up a few water bottles each\n","morning and place them in common locations around the house.\n","If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part\n","of your environment. e most persistent behaviors usually have multiple\n","cues. Consider how many diﬀerent ways a smoker could be prompted to pullout a cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend smoke, feeling stressed at\n","work, and so on.\n","e same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling\n","triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll\n","think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the\n","most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the\n","cues for good habits are right in front of you.\n","Environment design is powerful not only because it in\u0000uences how we\n","engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a\n","world others have created for them. But you can alter the spaces where you\n","live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your\n","exposure to negative ones. Environment design allows you to take back\n","control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world\n","and not merely the consumer of it.\n","THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE\n","e cues that trigger a habit can start out very speci\u0000c, but over time your\n","habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context\n","surrounding the behavior.\n","For example, many people drink more in social situations than they\n","would ever drink alone. e trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the\n","whole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at\n","the bar, seeing the beers on tap.\n","We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the\n","home, the oﬃce, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain\n","habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship with the objects\n","on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the things in your\n","bedroom.\n","Our behavior is not de\u0000ned by the objects in the environment but by our\n","relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the in\u0000uence\n","of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your\n","environment as \u0000lled with objects. Start thinking about it as \u0000lled with\n","relationships. ink in terms of how you interact with the spaces around\n","you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour eachnight. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats a\n","bowl of ice cream aer work. Diﬀerent people can have diﬀerent memories\n","—and thus diﬀerent habits—associated with the same place.\n","e good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a\n","particular context.\n","In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only when\n","they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit in a diﬀerent\n","room until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects began to associate the\n","context of their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became easier to\n","quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed. eir brains learned that\n","sleeping—not browsing on their phones, not watching television, not staring\n","at the clock—was the only action that happened in that room.\n","e power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be\n","easier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle triggers\n","and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a\n","diﬀerent coﬀee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom\n","use—and create a new routine there.\n","It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new\n","habit in the face of competing cues. It can be diﬃcult to go to bed early if\n","you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in\n","the living room without getting distracted if that’s where you always play\n","video games. But when you step outside your normal environment, you\n","leave your behavioral biases behind. You aren’t battling old environmental\n","cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.\n","Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooop patio, or\n","a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the space where\n","you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought\n","patterns.\n","Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your\n","regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may \u0000nd it easier to avoid\n","unhealthy food when your brain doesn’t automatically know where it is\n","located in the store.\n","When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, rede\u0000ne\n","or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study,\n","exercise, entertainment, and cooking. e mantra I \u0000nd useful is “One\n","space, one use.”When I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would oen work from\n","my couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very diﬃcult to\n","stop working. ere was no clear division between the end of work time and\n","the beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table my oﬃce or the space\n","where I ate meals? Was the couch where I relaxed or where I sent emails?\n","Everything happened in the same place.\n","A few years later, I could \u0000nally aﬀord to move to a home with a separate\n","room for my oﬃce. Suddenly, work was something that happened “in here”\n","and personal life was something that happened “out there.” It was easier for\n","me to turn oﬀ the professional side of my brain when there was a clear\n","dividing line between work life and home life. Each room had one primary\n","use. e kitchen was for cooking. e oﬃce was for working.\n","Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another.\n","When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier\n","ones will usually win out. is is one reason why the versatility of modern\n","technology is both a strength and a weakness. You can use your phone for all\n","sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful device. But when you can use your\n","phone to do nearly anything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task.\n","You want to be productive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social\n","media, check email, and play video games whenever you open your phone.\n","It’s a mishmash of cues.\n","You may be thinking, “You don’t understand. I live in New York City. My\n","apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to play multiple\n","roles.” Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity\n","zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do\n","the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer\n","only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social\n","media and texting. Every habit should have a home.\n","If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become\n","associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under\n","predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes automatically when you\n","are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space\n","designed for that purpose. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing that\n","happens in your bedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and\n","predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an\n","environment where habits can easily form.\n","Chapter Summary\n","Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over\n","time.\n","Every habit is initiated by a cue.

While visiting\n","the troops, they had learned that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers stationed\n","there were heroin addicts. Follow-up research revealed that 35 percent of\n","service members in Vietnam had tried heroin and as many as 20 percent\n","were addicted—the problem was even worse than they had initially thought.\n","e discovery led to a \u0000urry of activity in Washington, including the\n","creation of the Special Action Oﬃce of Drug Abuse Prevention under\n","President Nixon to promote prevention and rehabilitation and to track\n","addicted service members when they returned home.\n","Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a \u0000nding that\n","completely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that\n","when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of\n","them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within\n","three years. In other words, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used\n","heroin in Vietnam eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.\n","is \u0000nding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which\n","considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition.\n","Instead, Robins revealed that addictions could spontaneously dissolve if\n","there was a radical change in the environment. In Vietnam, soldiers spent all\n","day surrounded by cues triggering heroin use: it was easy to access, theywere engulfed by the constant stress of war, they built friendships with\n","fellow soldiers who were also heroin users, and they were thousands of miles\n","from home. Once a soldier returned to the United States, though, he found\n","himself in an environment devoid of those triggers. When the context\n","changed, so did the habit.\n","Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone becomes\n","addicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get clean—which is\n","devoid of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then\n","returns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous cues that caused\n","them to get addicted in the \u0000rst place. It’s no wonder that usually you see\n","numbers that are the exact opposite of those in the Vietnam study. Typically,\n","90 percent of heroin users become re-addicted once they return home from\n","rehab.\n","e Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about\n","bad habits because it challenged the conventional association of unhealthy\n","behavior as a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker, or an addict,\n","you’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—\n","maybe even that you’re a bad person. e idea that a little bit of discipline\n","would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture.\n","Recent research, however, shows something diﬀerent. When scientists\n","analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out\n","those individuals aren’t all that diﬀerent from those who are struggling.\n","Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that\n","does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they\n","spend less time in tempting situations.\n","e people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to\n","use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use\n","it very oen. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to\n","success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a\n","more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.\n","is counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand\n","what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit that has been\n","encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation\n","arises. When Patty Olwell, a therapist from Austin, Texas, started smoking,\n","she would oen light up while riding horses with a friend. Eventually, she\n","quit smoking and avoided it for years. She had also stopped riding. Decadeslater, she hopped on a horse again and found herself craving a cigarette for\n","the \u0000rst time in forever. e cues were still internalized; she just hadn’t been\n","exposed to them in a long time.\n","Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the\n","environmental cues reappear. is is one reason behavior change techniques\n","can back\u0000re. Shaming obese people with weight-loss presentations can make\n","them feel stressed, and as a result many people return to their favorite\n","coping strategy: overeating. Showing pictures of blackened lungs to smokers\n","leads to higher levels of anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a\n","cigarette. If you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior\n","you want to stop.\n","Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. ey foster the\n","feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you\n","eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so\n","you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything\n","else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you\n","to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and\n","soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of\n","bad habits.\n","Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an\n","external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you\n","notice something, you begin to want it. is process is happening all the\n","time—oen without us realizing it. Scientists have found that showing\n","addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three milliseconds stimulates the\n","reward pathway in the brain and sparks desire. is speed is too fast for the\n","brain to consciously register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you what they\n","had seen—but they craved the drug all the same.\n","Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget\n","it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they\n","are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a\n","while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineﬀective\n","strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life \u0000lled with\n","interruptions. It takes too much energy. In the short-run, you can choose to\n","overpower temptation. In the long-run, we become a product of the\n","environment that we live in. To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone\n","consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits oﬀ at the source. One of the\n","most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue\n","that causes it.\n","If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another\n","room for a few hours.\n","If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following\n","social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.\n","If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out\n","of the bedroom.\n","If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews\n","of the latest tech gear.\n","If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it\n","in a closet aer each use.\n","is practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change.

When he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went\n","crazy with delight. ey pecked at the little red patches as if it was the\n","greatest beak they had ever seen.\n","Tinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other\n","animals. For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird.Occasionally, as the mother moves around on the nest, one of the eggs will\n","roll out and settle on the grass nearby. Whenever this happens, the goose\n","will waddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it back into the\n","nest.\n","Tinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round object,\n","such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. e bigger the object,\n","the greater their response. One goose even made a tremendous eﬀort to roll\n","a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls automatically pecking at\n","red dots, the greylag goose was following an instinctive rule: When I see a\n","round object nearby, I must roll it back into the nest. e bigger the round\n","object, the harder I should try to get it.\n","It’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for\n","behavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it\n","lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as\n","supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of\n","reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—\n","and it elicits a stronger response than usual.\n","Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk\n","food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. Aer spending\n","hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild,\n","the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat.\n","Such foods are oen calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our\n","ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don’t know where\n","your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent\n","strategy for survival.\n","Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant,\n","but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on\n","salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving\n","persists because the brain’s reward centers have not changed for\n","approximately \u0000y thousand years. e modern food industry relies on\n","stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose.\n","A primary goal of food science is to create products that are more\n","attractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or jar has been\n","enhanced in some way, if only with additional \u0000avoring. Companies spend\n","millions of dollars to discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a potato\n","chip or the perfect amount of \u0000zz in a soda. Entire departments arededicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth—a quality\n","known as orosensation. French fries, for example, are a potent combination\n","—golden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth on the inside.\n","Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to items\n","with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy. Imagine the\n","gooeyness of melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of\n","an Oreo cookie combined with its smooth center. With natural, unprocessed\n","foods, you tend to experience the same sensations over and over—how’s that\n","seventeenth bite of kale taste? Aer a few minutes, your brain loses interest\n","and you begin to feel full. But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep\n","the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat more.\n","Ultimately, such strategies enable food scientists to \u0000nd the “bliss point”\n","for each product—the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat that excites\n","your brain and keeps you coming back for more. e result, of course, is that\n","you overeat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive to the human\n","brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in eating\n","behavior and obesity, says, “We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own\n","buttons.”\n","e modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is\n","just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. e\n","more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-\n","forming.\n","Look around. Society is \u0000lled with highly engineered versions of reality\n","that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores\n","feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social\n","media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever\n","get in the oﬃce or at home. Online porn splices together stimulating scenes\n","at a rate that would be impossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements are\n","created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and\n","Photoshopped edits—even the model doesn’t look like the person in the\n","\u0000nal image. ese are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. ey\n","exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go\n","wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media\n","habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others.\n","If history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be more\n","attractive than those of today. e trend is for rewards to become moreconcentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more\n","concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a more\n","concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a more\n","concentrated form of play than board games. Compared to nature, these\n","pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our\n","ancestors but temptations they never had to face.\n","If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need\n","to make it attractive. roughout our discussion of the 2nd Law, our goal is\n","to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to\n","transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit\n","more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is\n","and how it works.\n","We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the\n","dopamine spike.\n","THE DOP AMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP\n","Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a\n","neurotransmitter called dopamine.* e importance of dopamine became\n","apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran\n","an experiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and\n","desire. By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked\n","the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will\n","to live. ey wouldn’t eat. ey wouldn’t have sex. ey didn’t crave\n","anything. Within a few days, the animals died of thirst.\n","In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-\n","releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of\n","sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. eir little rat faces lit\n","up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine\n","was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want\n","it anymore. e ability to experience pleasure remained, but without\n","dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.\n","When other researchers reversed this process and \u0000ooded the reward\n","system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck\n","speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each timethey poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a\n","craving so strong they began poking their nose into the box eight hundred\n","times per hour. (Humans are not so diﬀerent: the average slot machine\n","player will spin the wheel six hundred times per hour.)\n","Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is\n","highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games,\n","browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. e\n","same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food,\n","drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.\n","For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now\n","we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including\n","motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary\n","movement.\n","When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released\n","not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.\n","Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not\n","aer they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the\n","powder, not aer they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity\n","will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And\n","whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.\n","It is the anticipation of a reward—not the ful\u0000llment of it—that gets us to\n","take action.\n","Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you\n","receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a\n","reward. is is one reason the anticipation of an experience can oen feel\n","better than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas\n","morning can be better than opening the gis. As an adult, daydreaming\n","about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on\n","vacation. Scientists refer to this as the diﬀerence between “wanting” and\n","“liking.”\n","THE DOP AMINE SPIKEFIGURE 9: Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released\n","when the reward is experienced for the first time. The next time\n","around (B), dopamine rises b e f o r e taking action, immediately\n","after a cue is recognized. This spike leads to a feeling of desire\n","and a craving to take action whenever the cue is spotted. Once\n","a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is\n","experienced because you already expect the reward. However,\n","if you see a cue and expect a reward, but do not get one, then\n","dopamine will drop in disappointment (C). The sensitivity of the\n","dopamine response can clearly be seen when a reward is\n","provided late (D). First, the cue is identified and dopamine rises\n","as a craving builds. Next, a response is taken but the reward\n","does not come as quickly as expected and dopamine begins to\n","drop. Finally, when the reward comes a little later than you had\n","hoped, dopamine spikes again. It is as if the brain is saying,\n","“See! I knew I was right. Don’t forget to repeat this action next\n","time.”\n","Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards\n","than for liking them. e wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain\n","stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal\n","striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By\n","comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. ey are oen\n","referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are distributed like tiny islands\n","throughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent\n","of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10\n","percent of the structure is activated during liking.\n","e fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions\n","responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial\n","role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every\n","action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving\n","that leads to the response.\n","ese insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change.\n","We need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a\n","rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the \u0000rst place. is is where\n","a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.HOW T O USE TEMPT A TION BUNDLING T O MAKE YOUR\n","HABITS MORE A TTRACTIVE\n","Ronan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland, enjoyed\n","watching Net\u0000ix, but he also knew that he should exercise more oen than\n","he did. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary\n","bike and connected it to his laptop and television. en he wrote a computer\n","program that would allow Net\u0000ix to run only if he was cycling at a certain\n","speed. If he slowed down for too long, whatever show he was watching\n","would pause until he started pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan,\n","“eliminating obesity one Net\u0000ix binge at a time.”\n","He was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercise habit\n","more attractive. Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want\n","to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching\n","Net\u0000ix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing\n","he needed to do).\n","Businesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when the\n","American Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC,\n","launched its ursday-night television lineup for the 2014–2015 season,\n","they promoted temptation bundling on a massive scale.\n","Every ursday, the company would air three shows created by\n","screenwriter Shonda Rhimes—Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get\n","Away with Murder. ey branded it as “TGIT on ABC” (TGIT stands for\n","ank God It’s ursday). In addition to promoting the shows, ABC\n","encouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and enjoy the\n","evening.\n","Andrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea behind\n","the campaign: “We see ursday night as a viewership opportunity, with\n","either couples or women by themselves who want to sit down and escape\n","and have fun and drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” e\n","brilliance of this strategy is that ABC was associating the thing they needed\n","viewers to do (watch their shows) with activities their viewers already\n","wanted to do (relax, drink wine, and eat popcorn).\n","Over time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling relaxed\n","and entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8 p.m. every\n","ursday, then eventually “8 p.m. on ursday” means relaxation andentertainment. e reward gets associated with the cue, and the habit of\n","turning on the television becomes more attractive.\n","You’re more likely to \u0000nd a behavior attractive if you get to do one of\n","your favorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear about the\n","latest celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using temptation\n","bundling, you could only read the tabloids and watch reality shows at the\n","gym. Maybe you want to get a pedicure, but you need to clean out your\n","email inbox. Solution: only get a pedicure while processing overdue work\n","emails.\n","Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as\n","Premack’s Principle. Named aer the work of professor David Premack, the\n","principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable\n","behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue\n","work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do\n","something you really want to do along the way.\n","You can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking\n","strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your\n","behavior.\n","e habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:\n","1. Aer [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].\n","2. Aer [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].\n","If you want to read the news, but you need to express more gratitude:\n","1. Aer I get my morning coﬀee, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that\n","happened yesterday (need).\n","2. Aer I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).\n","If you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls:\n","1. Aer I get back from my lunch break, I will call three potential clients\n","(need).2. Aer I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).\n","If you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more:\n","1. Aer I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).\n","2. Aer I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).\n","e hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling three clients or\n","doing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest sports news or\n","check Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do means you get to do the\n","thing you want to do.\n","We began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are\n","heightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action.\n","Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit\n","by connecting it with something you already want. Engineering a truly\n","irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be employed to\n","make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be otherwise.\n","Chapter Summary\n","e 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.\n","e more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become\n","habit-forming.\n","Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.

In fact, it was all he believed in:\n","he completely rejected the idea of innate talent. He claimed that with\n","deliberate practice and the development of good habits, a child could\n","become a genius in any \u0000eld. His mantra was “A genius is not born, but is\n","educated and trained.”\n","Laszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with his\n","own children—and he was writing to Klara because he “needed a wife\n","willing to jump on board.” Klara was a teacher and, although she may not\n","have been as adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper\n","instruction, anyone could advance their skills.\n","Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable \u0000eld for the experiment, and he\n","laid out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies. e kids\n","would be home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. e house would\n","be \u0000lled with chess books and pictures of famous chess players. e children\n","would play against each other constantly and compete in the best\n","tournaments they could \u0000nd. e family would keep a meticulous \u0000le\n","system of the tournament history of every competitor the children faced.\n","eir lives would be dedicated to chess.Laszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the Polgars\n","were parents to three young girls: Susan, So\u0000a, and Judit.\n","Susan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old.\n","Within six months, she was defeating adults.\n","So\u0000a, the middle child, did even better. By fourteen, she was a world\n","champion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster.\n","Judit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age \u0000ve, she could beat her\n","father. At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among the top one\n","hundred chess players in the world. At \u0000een years and four months old, she\n","became the youngest grandmaster of all time—younger than Bobby Fischer,\n","the previous record holder. For twenty-seven years, she was the number-\n","one-ranked female chess player in the world.\n","e childhood of the Polgar sisters was atypical, to say the least. And yet,\n","if you ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle was attractive, even\n","enjoyable. In interviews, the sisters talk about their childhood as\n","entertaining rather than grueling. ey loved playing chess. ey couldn’t\n","get enough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found So\u0000a playing chess in the\n","bathroom in the middle of the night. Encouraging her to go back to sleep, he\n","said, “So\u0000a, leave the pieces alone!” To which she replied, “Daddy, they won’t\n","leave me alone!”\n","e Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all else\n","—praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession\n","with chess was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever habits are\n","normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll \u0000nd.\n","THE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS\n","Humans are herd animals. We want to \u0000t in, to bond with others, and to\n","earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to\n","our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in\n","tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a\n","death sentence. “e lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.”*\n","Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed\n","increased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As Charles\n","Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned tocollaborate and improvise most eﬀectively have prevailed.” As a result, one\n","of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts\n","a powerful in\u0000uence on our modern behavior.\n","We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the script\n","handed down by our friends and family, our church or school, our local\n","community and society at large. Each of these cultures and groups comes\n","with its own set of expectations and standards—when and whether to get\n","married, how many children to have, which holidays to celebrate, how much\n","money to spend on your child’s birthday party. In many ways, these social\n","norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day. You’re\n","always keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not top of your mind.\n","Oen, you follow the habits of your culture without thinking, without\n","questioning, and sometimes without remembering. As the French\n","philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “e customs and practices of life\n","in society sweep us along.”\n","Most of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a burden.\n","Everyone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that rewards you for\n","your chess skills, playing chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do. If\n","you work in a job where everyone wears expensive suits, then you’ll be\n","inclined to splurge on one as well. If all of your friends are sharing an inside\n","joke or using a new phrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you\n","“get it.” Behaviors are attractive when they help us \u0000t in.\n","We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\n","1. e close.\n","2. e many.\n","3. e powerful.\n","Each group oﬀers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior\n","Change and make our habits more attractive.\n","1. Imitating the Close\n","Proximity has a powerful eﬀect on our behavior. is is true of the physical\n","environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true of the socialenvironment.\n","We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our\n","parents handle arguments, the way our peers \u0000irt with one another, the way\n","our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it a try,\n","too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is locked\n","before going to bed, you pick it up as well.\n","I \u0000nd that I oen imitate the behavior of those around me without\n","realizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically assume the body posture of\n","the other person. In college, I began to talk like my roommates. When\n","traveling to other countries, I unconsciously imitate the local accent despite\n","reminding myself to stop.\n","As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to\n","imitate some of their habits. One groundbreaking study tracked twelve\n","thousand people for thirty-two years and found that “a person’s chances of\n","becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a friend who\n","became obese.” It works the other way, too. Another study found that if one\n","person in a relationship lost weight, the other partner would also slim down\n","about one third of the time. Our friends and family provide a sort of\n","invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.\n","Of course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad\n","in\u0000uences. When astronaut Mike Massimino was a graduate student at MIT,\n","he took a small robotics class. Of the ten people in the class, four became\n","astronauts. If your goal was to make it into space, then that room was about\n","the best culture you could ask for. Similarly, one study found that the higher\n","your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ would be at\n","age \u0000een, even aer controlling for natural levels of intelligence. We soak\n","up the qualities and practices of those around us.\n","One of the most eﬀective things you can do to build better habits is to\n","join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New\n","habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are\n","surrounded by \u0000t people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a\n","common habit. If you’re surrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to\n","believe it’s reasonable to play jazz every day. Your culture sets your\n","expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself with people who have\n","the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together.To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one\n","step further.\n","Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and\n","(2) you already have something in common with the group. Steve Kamb, an\n","entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which\n","“helps nerds, mis\u0000ts, and mutants lose weight, get strong, and get healthy.”\n","His clients include video game lovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who\n","want to get in shape. Many people feel out of place the \u0000rst time they go to\n","the gym or try to change their diet, but if you are already similar to the other\n","members of the group in some way—say, your mutual love of Star Wars—\n","change becomes more appealing because it feels like something people like\n","you already do.\n","Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It\n","transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your\n","own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You\n","are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your\n","identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no\n","longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are\n","cyclists. e shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. is is\n","why remaining part of a group aer achieving a goal is crucial to\n","maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new\n","identity and help behaviors last over the long run.\n","2. Imitating the Many\n","In the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a series of experiments\n","that are now taught to legions of undergrads each year. To begin each\n","experiment, the subject entered the room with a group of strangers.\n","Unbeknownst to them, the other participants were actors planted by the\n","researcher and instructed to deliver scripted answers to certain questions.\n","e group would be shown one card with a line on it and then a second\n","card with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select the line on the\n","second card that was similar in length to the line on the \u0000rst card. It was a\n","very simple task. Here is an example of two cards used in the experiment:CONFORMING T O SOCIAL NORMS\n","FIGURE 10: This is a representation of two cards used by\n","Solomon Asch in his famous social conformity experiments. The\n","length of the line on the first card (left) is obviously the same as\n","line C, but when a group of actors claimed it was a different\n","length the research subjects would often change their minds and\n","go with the crowd rather than believe their own eyes.\n","e experiment always began the same. First, there would be some easy\n","trials where everyone agreed on the correct line. Aer a few rounds, the\n","participants were shown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones,\n","except the actors in the room would select an intentionally incorrect answer.\n","For example, they would respond “A” to the comparison shown in Figure 10.\n","Everyone would agree that the lines were the same even though they were\n","clearly diﬀerent.e subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediately become\n","bewildered. eir eyes would open wide. ey would laugh nervously to\n","themselves. ey would double-check the reactions of other participants.\n","eir agitation would grow as one person aer another delivered the same\n","incorrect response. Soon, the subject began to doubt their own eyes.\n","Eventually, they delivered the answer they knew in their heart to be\n","incorrect.\n","Asch ran this experiment many times and in many diﬀerent ways. What\n","he discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did the\n","conformity of the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor, then there\n","was no eﬀect on the person’s choice. ey just assumed they were in the\n","room with a dummy. When two actors were in the room with the subject,\n","there was still little impact. But as the number of people increased to three\n","actors and four and all the way to eight, the subject became more likely to\n","second-guess themselves. By the end of the experiment, nearly 75 percent of\n","the subjects had agreed with the group answer even though it was obviously\n","incorrect.\n","Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our\n","behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering,\n","“What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or\n","TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel\n","habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. ere is evidence in numbers.\n","But there can be a downside.\n","e normal behavior of the tribe oen overpowers the desired behavior\n","of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee\n","learns an eﬀective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and\n","then switches to a new group that uses a less eﬀective strategy, it will avoid\n","using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the\n","chimps.\n","Humans are similar. ere is tremendous internal pressure to comply\n","with the norms of the group. e reward of being accepted is oen greater\n","than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or \u0000nding truth.\n","Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.\n","e human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get\n","along with others. is is our natural mode. You can override it—you canchoose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it\n","takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra eﬀort.\n","When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is\n","unattractive. When changing your habits means \u0000tting in with the tribe,\n","change is very attractive.\n","3. Imitating the Powerful\n","Humans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We want pins and\n","medallions on our jackets. We want President or Partner in our titles. We\n","want to be acknowledged, recognized, and praised. is tendency can seem\n","vain, but overall, it’s a smart move. Historically, a person with greater power\n","and status has access to more resources, worries less about survival, and\n","proves to be a more attractive mate.\n","We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration,\n","and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the\n","musician who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the\n","most accomplished children because these things separate us from the\n","crowd. Once we \u0000t in, we start looking for ways to stand out.\n","is is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly eﬀective\n","people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire\n","success ourselves. Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we\n","admire. You replicate the marketing strategies of the most successful \u0000rms in\n","your industry. You make a recipe from your favorite baker. You borrow the\n","storytelling strategies of your favorite writer. You mimic the communication\n","style of your boss. We imitate people we envy.\n","High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And\n","that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we \u0000nd it\n","attractive.\n","We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. We\n","trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’t want to be the slob of\n","the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house\n","because we don’t want to be judged. We are continually wondering “What\n","will others think of me?” and altering our behavior based on the answer.e Polgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginning of\n","this chapter—are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact social\n","in\u0000uences can have on our behavior. e sisters practiced chess for many\n","hours each day and continued this remarkable eﬀort for decades. But these\n","habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness, in part, because they\n","were valued by their culture. From the praise of their parents to the\n","achievement of diﬀerent status markers like becoming a grandmaster, they\n","had many reasons to continue their eﬀort.\n","Chapter Summary\n","e culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.\n","We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture\n","because we have a strong desire to \u0000t in and belong to the tribe.\n","We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family\n","and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status\n","and prestige).\n","One of the most eﬀective things you can do to build better habits is to\n","join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior\n","and (2) you already have something in common with the group.\n","e normal behavior of the tribe oen overpowers the desired behavior\n","of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than\n","be right by ourselves.\n","If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we \u0000nd it\n","attractive.I\n","10\n","How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your\n","Bad Habits\n","N LATE 2012, I was sitting in an old apartment just a few blocks from\n","Istanbul’s most famous street, Istiklal Caddesi. I was in the middle of a\n","four-day trip to Turkey and my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a worn-out\n","armchair a few feet away.\n","Mike wasn’t really a guide. He was just a guy from Maine who had been\n","living in Turkey for \u0000ve years, but he oﬀered to show me around while I was\n","visiting the country and I took him up on it. On this particular night, I had\n","been invited to dinner with him and a handful of his Turkish friends.\n","ere were seven of us, and I was the only one who hadn’t, at some point,\n","smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day. I asked one of the Turks how\n","he got started. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with your friends. One\n","friend smokes, then you try it.”\n","What was truly fascinating was that half of the people in the room had\n","managed to quit smoking. Mike had been smoke-free for a few years at that\n","point, and he swore up and down that he broke the habit because of a book\n","called Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking.\n","“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he said. “It tells you:\n","‘Stop lying to yourself. You know you don’t actually want to smoke. You\n","know you don’t really enjoy this.’ It helps you feel like you’re not the victim\n","anymore. You start to realize that you don’t need to smoke.”I had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the book aerward out\n","of curiosity. e author employs an interesting strategy to help smokers\n","eliminate their cravings. He systematically reframes each cue associated with\n","smoking and gives it a new meaning.\n","He says things like:\n","You think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting anything\n","because cigarettes do nothing for you.\n","You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it’s\n","not. You can be social without smoking at all.\n","You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking does\n","not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.\n","Over and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get it\n","clearly into your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are making\n","marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in\n","con\u0000dence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length\n","and quality of your future life.”\n","By the time you get to the end of the book, smoking seems like the most\n","ridiculous thing in the world to do. And if you no longer expect smoking to\n","bring you any bene\u0000ts, you have no reason to smoke. It is an inversion of the\n","2nd Law of Behavior Change: make it unattractive.\n","Now, I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just change your mind\n","and you can quit smoking. But stick with me for a minute.\n","WHERE CRA VINGS COME FROM\n","Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive. I\n","oen have a craving that goes something like this: “I want to eat tacos.” If\n","you were to ask me why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t say, “Because I need\n","food to survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I am motivated to\n","eat tacos because I have to eat to survive. e underlying motive is to obtain\n","food and water even if my speci\u0000c craving is for a taco.\n","Some of our underlying motives include:*Conserve energy\n","Obtain food and water\n","Find love and reproduce\n","Connect and bond with others\n","Win social acceptance and approval\n","Reduce uncertainty\n","Achieve status and prestige\n","A craving is just a speci\u0000c manifestation of a deeper underlying motive.\n","Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check\n","Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce\n","uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to\n","achieve status.\n","Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it\n","does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying\n","motives of human nature.\n","Find love and reproduce = using Tinder\n","Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook\n","Win social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram\n","Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google\n","Achieve status and prestige = playing video games\n","Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of\n","old vices. e underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same.\n","e speci\u0000c habits we perform diﬀer based on the period of history.\n","Here’s the powerful part: there are many diﬀerent ways to address the\n","same underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress by\n","smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by going for\n","a run. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the\n","problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you\n","associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming\n","back to it.\n","Habits are all about associations. ese associations determine whether\n","we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered in ourdiscussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information\n","and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your\n","brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next\n","moment.\n","Cue: You notice that the stove is hot.\n","Prediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.\n","Cue: You see that the traﬃc light turned green.\n","Prediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the intersection and\n","get closer to my destination, so I should step on the gas.\n","You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the\n","appropriate response.\n","is all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role in your habits\n","because every action is preceded by a prediction. Life feels reactive, but it is\n","actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to\n","act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You\n","are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.\n","Our behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. Put another way,\n","our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that\n","happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves.\n","Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke\n","while the other is repulsed by the smell. e same cue can spark a good\n","habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. e cause of your habits\n","is actually the prediction that precedes them.\n","ese predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a\n","craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the\n","cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can\n","apply. ey help explain what we are currently sensing. For instance,\n","whether or not you realize it, you are noticing how warm or cold you feel\n","right now. If the temperature drops by one degree, you probably won’t do\n","anything. If the temperature drops ten degrees, however, you’ll feel cold and\n","put on another layer of clothing. Feeling cold was the signal that prompted\n","you to act. You have been sensing the cues the entire time, but it is onlywhen you predict that you would be better oﬀ in a diﬀerent state that you\n","take action.\n","A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change\n","your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what\n","your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. is gap\n","between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act.\n","Desire is the diﬀerence between where you are now and where you want\n","to be in the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to\n","feel diﬀerently than you do in the moment. When you binge-eat or light up\n","or browse social media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a\n","cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel diﬀerent.\n","Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current\n","state or to make a change. ey help us decide the best course of action.\n","Neurologists have discovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired,\n","we actually lose the ability to make decisions. We have no signal of what to\n","pursue and what to avoid. As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains,\n","“It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indiﬀerent.”\n","To summarize, the speci\u0000c cravings you feel and habits you perform are\n","really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives.\n","Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to\n","do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help\n","you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears.\n","Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we\n","can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.\n","HOW T O REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN T O ENJOY HARD HABITS\n","You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them\n","with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shi.\n","For instance, we oen talk about everything we have to do in a given day.\n","You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for\n","your business. You have to cook dinner for your family.\n","Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.\n","You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for\n","your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changingone word, you shi the way you view each event. You transition from seeing\n","these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\n","e key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do\n","those things, and you also get to do them. We can \u0000nd evidence for whatever\n","mind-set we choose.\n","I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it\n","was diﬃcult being con\u0000ned, he responded, “I’m not con\u0000ned to my\n","wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be\n","bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” is shi in perspective\n","completely transformed how he lived each day.\n","Reframing your habits to highlight their bene\u0000ts rather than their\n","drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a\n","habit seem more attractive.\n","Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task\n","that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a\n","way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to\n","go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.”\n","Finance. Saving money is oen associated with sacri\u0000ce. However, you\n","can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize one simple\n","truth: living below your current means increases your future means. e\n","money you save this month increases your purchasing power next month.\n","Meditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three\n","seconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next distraction\n","inevitably pops into your mind. You can transform frustration into delight\n","when you realize that each interruption gives you a chance to practice\n","returning to your breath. Distraction is a good thing because you need\n","distractions to practice meditation.\n","Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big\n","presentation or competing in an important event. ey experience quicker\n","breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these\n","feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret\n","these feelings positively, then we can respond with \u0000uidity and grace. You\n","can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline\n","rush to help me concentrate.”\n","ese little mind-set shis aren’t magic, but they can help change the\n","feelings you associate with a particular habit or situation.If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual.\n","You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then\n","you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation. For instance, if\n","you always play the same song before having sex, then you’ll begin to link\n","the music with the act. Whenever you want to get in the mood, just press\n","play.\n","Ed Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, bene\u0000ted from a\n","similar strategy without knowing it. “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My focus\n","and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while\n","writing. I don’t even have to play any music.” Without realizing it, he was\n","conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his headphones on, played\n","some music he enjoyed, and did focused work. Aer doing it \u0000ve, ten,\n","twenty times, putting his headphones on became a cue that he automatically\n","associated with increased focus. e craving followed naturally.\n","Athletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the mind-set to\n","perform. During my baseball career, I developed a speci\u0000c ritual of\n","stretching and throwing before each game. e whole sequence took about\n","ten minutes, and I did it the same way every single time. While it physically\n","warmed me up to play, more importantly, it put me in the right mental state.\n","I began to associate my pregame ritual with feeling competitive and focused.\n","Even if I wasn’t motivated beforehand, by the time I was done with my\n","ritual, I was in “game mode.”\n","You can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel\n","happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—like petting\n","your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine that you\n","perform every time before you do the thing you love. Maybe you take three\n","deep breaths and smile.\n","ree deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat.\n","Eventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine with\n","being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy. Once\n","established, you can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional\n","state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and smile. Sad about life?\n","ree deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has been built, the cue can\n","prompt a craving, even if it has little to do with the original situation.\n","e key to \u0000nding and \u0000xing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe\n","the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you can reprogramyour predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one.\n","Chapter Summary\n","e inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it\n","unattractive.\n","Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying\n","motive.\n","Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.\n","e cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.\n","e prediction leads to a feeling.\n","Highlight the bene\u0000ts of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem\n","unattractive.\n","Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and\n","unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.

On the \u0000nal day of class, he would tally the number of photos\n","submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety\n","photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.\n","Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the\n","“quality” group. ey would be graded only on the excellence of their work.\n","ey would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get\n","an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.\n","At the end of the term, he was surprised to \u0000nd that all the best photos\n","were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students\n","were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting,\n","testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their\n","mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their\n","skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection.\n","In the end, they had little to show for their eﬀorts other than unveri\u0000ed\n","theories and one mediocre photo.*\n","It is easy to get bogged down trying to \u0000nd the optimal plan for change:\n","the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect\n","idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on \u0000guring out the best approachthat we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “e best\n","is the enemy of the good.”\n","I refer to this as the diﬀerence between being in motion and taking\n","action. e two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re\n","in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. ose are all good\n","things, but they don’t produce a result.\n","Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an\n","outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion.\n","If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better\n","diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a\n","healthy meal, that’s action.\n","Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by\n","itself. It doesn’t matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer,\n","that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will\n","get the result you’re looking to achieve.\n","If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it\n","because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more oen than not, we\n","do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without\n","running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It\n","doesn’t feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid\n","situations where that might happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you\n","slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.\n","It’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you’re still making\n","progress. You think, “I’ve got conversations going with four potential clients\n","right now. is is good. We’re moving in the right direction.” Or, “I\n","brainstormed some ideas for that book I want to write. is is coming\n","together.”\n","Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re\n","just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of\n","procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be\n","planning. You want to be practicing.\n","If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not\n","perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just\n","need to practice it. is is the \u0000rst takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to\n","get your reps in.HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALL Y T AKE T O FORM A NEW\n","HABIT?\n","Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively\n","more automatic through repetition. e more you repeat an activity, the\n","more the structure of your brain changes to become eﬃcient at that activity.\n","Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the\n","strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent\n","patterns of activity. With each repetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and\n","the neural connections tighten. First described by neuropsychologist\n","Donald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law:\n","“Neurons that \u0000re together wire together.”\n","Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. In\n","musicians, the cerebellum—critical for physical movements like plucking a\n","guitar string or pulling a violin bow—is larger than it is in nonmusicians.\n","Mathematicians, meanwhile, have increased gray matter in the inferior\n","parietal lobule, which plays a key role in computation and calculation. Its\n","size is directly correlated with the amount of time spent in the \u0000eld; the\n","older and more experienced the mathematician, the greater the increase in\n","gray matter.\n","When scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they found\n","that the hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in spatial memory—\n","was signi\u0000cantly larger in their subjects than in non–taxi drivers. Even more\n","fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a driver retired. Like\n","the muscles of the body responding to regular weight training, particular\n","regions of the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are\n","abandoned.\n","Of course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits was\n","recognized long before neuroscientists began poking around. In 1860, the\n","English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new\n","language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed\n","movements, great diﬃculty is felt, because the channels through which each\n","sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner has\n","frequent repetition cut a pathway, than this diﬃculty vanishes; the actions\n","become so automatic that they can be performed while the mind isotherwise engaged.” Both common sense and scienti\u0000c evidence agree:\n","repetition is a form of change.\n","Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural\n","circuit associated with that habit. is means that simply putting in your\n","reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. It\n","is why the students who took tons of photos improved their skills while\n","those who merely theorized about perfect photos did not. One group\n","engaged in active practice, the other in passive learning. One in action, the\n","other in motion.\n","All habits follow a similar trajectory from eﬀortful practice to automatic\n","behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to\n","perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when\n","the nonconscious mind takes over.\n","It looks something like this:\n","THE HABIT LINEFIGURE 11: In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good\n","deal of effort and concentration to perform. After a few\n","repetitions (point B), it gets easier, but still requires some\n","conscious attention. With enough practice (point C), the habit\n","becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold\n","— t h e  h a b i t  l i n e—the behavior can be done more or less without\n","thinking. A new habit has been formed.\n","On the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when researchers\n","track the level of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for ten\n","minutes each day. e shape of these charts, which scientists call learning\n","curves, reveals an important truth about behavior change: habits form based\n","on frequency, not time.\n","W ALKING 10 MINUTES PER DA YFIGURE 12: This graph shows someone who built the habit of\n","walking for ten minutes after breakfast each day. Notice that as\n","the repetitions increase, so does automaticity, until the behavior\n","is as easy and automatic as it can be.\n","One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to\n","build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many\n","does it take to form a new habit?” at is, how many repetitions are required\n","to make a habit automatic?\n","ere is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit\n","formation. It doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one days or thirty days or\n","three hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you perform the\n","behavior. You could do something twice in thirty days, or two hundred\n","times. It’s the frequency that makes the diﬀerence. Your current habits have\n","been internalized over the course of hundreds, if not thousands, of\n","repetitions. New habits require the same level of frequency. You need to\n","string together enough successful attempts until the behavior is \u0000rmly\n","embedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line.\n","In practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for a habit to become\n","automatic. What matters is that you take the actions you need to take tomake progress. Whether an action is fully automatic is of less importance.\n","To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most eﬀective way to\n","make practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make\n","it easy. e chapters that follow will show you how to do exactly that.\n","Chapter Summary\n","e 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy.\n","e most eﬀective form of learning is practice, not planning.\n","Focus on taking action, not being in motion.\n","Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes\n","progressively more automatic through repetition.\n","e amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as\n","important as the number of times you have performed it.I\n","12\n","The Law of Least Effort\n","N HIS AWARD-WINNING BOOK, Guns, Germs, and Steel, anthropologist and\n","biologist Jared Diamond points out a simple fact: diﬀerent continents have\n","diﬀerent shapes. At \u0000rst glance, this statement seems rather obvious and\n","unimportant, but it turns out to have a profound impact on human\n","behavior.\n","e primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. at is, the\n","landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin rather than\n","wide and fat. e same is generally true for Africa. Meanwhile, the landmass\n","that makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is the opposite. is\n","massive stretch of land tends to be more east-west in shape. According to\n","Diamond, this diﬀerence in shape played a signi\u0000cant role in the spread of\n","agriculture over the centuries.\n","When agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had an\n","easier time expanding along east-west routes than along north-south ones.\n","is is because locations along the same latitude generally share similar\n","climates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in season. ese\n","factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia to domesticate a few crops and\n","grow them along the entire stretch of land from France to China.\n","THE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHA VIORFIGURE 13: The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east-west.\n","The primary axis of the Americas and Africa is north-south. This\n","leads to a wider range of climates up-and-down the Americas\n","than across Europe and Asia. As a result, agriculture spread\n","nearly twice as fast across Europe and Asia than it did\n","elsewhere. The behavior of farmers—even across hundreds or\n","thousands of years—was constrained by the amount of friction\n","in the environment.\n","By comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from north to\n","south. Just imagine how diﬀerent the weather is in Florida compared to\n","Canada. You can be the most talented farmer in the world, but it won’t help\n","you grow Florida oranges in the Canadian winter. Snow is a poor substitute\n","for soil. In order to spread crops along north-south routes, farmers would\n","need to \u0000nd and domesticate new plants whenever the climate changed.\n","As a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster across Asia and\n","Europe than it did up and down the Americas. Over the span of centuries,this small diﬀerence had a very big impact. Increased food production\n","allowed for more rapid population growth. With more people, these cultures\n","were able to build stronger armies and were better equipped to develop new\n","technologies. e changes started out small—a crop that spread slightly\n","farther, a population that grew slightly faster—but compounded into\n","substantial diﬀerences over time.\n","e spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd Law of Behavior\n","Change on a global scale. Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the\n","key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But\n","the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient.\n","And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a\n","smart strategy, not a dumb one.\n","Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever\n","possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Eﬀort, which states\n","that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally\n","gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.* For\n","example, expanding your farm to the east where you can grow the same\n","crops rather than heading north where the climate is diﬀerent. Out of all the\n","possible actions we could take, the one that is realized is the one that\n","delivers the most value for the least eﬀort. We are motivated to do what is\n","easy.\n","Every action requires a certain amount of energy. e more energy\n","required, the less likely it is to occur. If your goal is to do a hundred push-\n","ups per day, that’s a lot of energy! In the beginning, when you’re motivated\n","and excited, you can muster the strength to get started. But aer a few days,\n","such a massive eﬀort feels exhausting. Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of\n","doing one push-up per day requires almost no energy to get started. And the\n","less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.\n","Look at any behavior that \u0000lls up much of your life and you’ll see that it\n","can be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling on\n","our phones, checking email, and watching television steal so much of our\n","time because they can be performed almost without eﬀort. ey are\n","remarkably convenient.\n","In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want.\n","Dieting is an obstacle to getting \u0000t. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm.\n","Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t actually want thehabit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. e\n","greater the obstacle—that is, the more diﬃcult the habit—the more friction\n","there is between you and your desired end state. is is why it is crucial to\n","make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it.\n","If you can make your good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to\n","follow through on them.\n","But what about all the moments when we seem to do the opposite? If\n","we’re all so lazy, then how do you explain people accomplishing hard things\n","like raising a child or starting a business or climbing Mount Everest?\n","Certainly, you are capable of doing very hard things. e problem is that\n","some days you feel like doing the hard work and some days you feel like\n","giving in. On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many things working in\n","your favor as possible so that you can overcome the challenges life naturally\n","throws your way. e less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger\n","self to emerge. e idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things.\n","e idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that\n","payoﬀ in the long run.\n","HOW T O ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT\n","Imagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle. Some\n","water can \u0000ow through, but not very much. If you want to increase the rate\n","at which water passes through the hose, you have two options. e \u0000rst\n","option is to crank up the valve and force more water out. e second option\n","is to simply remove the bend in the hose and let water \u0000ow through\n","naturally.\n","Trying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like\n","trying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requires a lot\n","of eﬀort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making your\n","habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose. Rather than\n","trying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it.\n","One of the most eﬀective ways to reduce the friction associated with your\n","habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we discussed\n","environment design as a method for making cues more obvious, but you can\n","also optimize your environment to make actions easier. For example, whendeciding where to practice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is\n","already along the path of your daily routine. Habits are easier to build when\n","they \u0000t into the \u0000ow of your life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is\n","on your way to work because stopping doesn’t add much friction to your\n","lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym is oﬀ the path of your normal commute\n","—even by just a few blocks—now you’re going “out of your way” to get\n","there.\n","Perhaps even more eﬀective is reducing the friction within your home or\n","oﬃce. Too oen, we try to start habits in high-friction environments. We try\n","to follow a strict diet while we are out to dinner with friends. We try to write\n","a book in a chaotic household. We try to concentrate while using a\n","smartphone \u0000lled with distractions. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can\n","remove the points of friction that hold us back. is is precisely what\n","electronics manufacturers in Japan began to do in the 1970s.\n","In an article published in the New Yorker titled “Better All the Time,”\n","James Suroweicki writes:\n","“Japanese \u0000rms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean production,’\n","relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the production\n","process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workers didn’t have to waste\n","time twisting and turning to reach their tools. e result was that Japanese\n","factories were more eﬃcient and Japanese products were more reliable than\n","American ones. In 1974, service calls for American-made color televisions\n","were \u0000ve times as common as for Japanese televisions. By 1979, it took\n","American workers three times as long to assemble their sets.”\n","I like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.* e Japanese\n","companies looked for every point of friction in the manufacturing process\n","and eliminated it. As they subtracted wasted eﬀort, they added customers\n","and revenue. Similarly, when we remove the points of friction that sap our\n","time and energy, we can achieve more with less eﬀort. (is is one reason\n","tidying up can feel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and\n","lightening the cognitive load our environment places on us.)\n","If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of\n","the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction\n","from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping for\n","groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions.Ride-sharing services reduce the friction of getting across town. Text\n","messaging reduces the friction of sending a letter in the mail.\n","Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace to\n","reduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to\n","automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. ey reduce the\n","number of \u0000elds on each form. ey pare down the number of clicks\n","required to create an account. ey deliver their products with easy-to-\n","understand directions or ask their customers to make fewer choices.\n","When the \u0000rst voice-activated speakers were released—products like\n","Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod—I asked a friend what\n","he liked about the product he had purchased. He said it was just easier to say\n","“Play some country music” than to pull out his phone, open the music app,\n","and pick a playlist. Of course, just a few years earlier, having unlimited\n","access to music in your pocket was a remarkably frictionless behavior\n","compared to driving to the store and buying a CD. Business is a never-\n","ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion.\n","Similar strategies have been used eﬀectively by governments. When the\n","British government wanted to increase tax collection rates, they switched\n","from sending citizens to a web page where the tax form could be\n","downloaded to linking directly to the form. Reducing that one step in the\n","process increased the response rate from 19.2 percent to 23.4 percent. For a\n","country like the United Kingdom, those percentage points represent\n","millions in tax revenue.\n","e central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing\n","is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes\n","down to \u0000nding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits\n","and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.\n","PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE\n","Oswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi. He is also\n","someone who understands the power of priming his environment.\n","Nuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by following a strategy he refers to\n","as “resetting the room.” For instance, when he \u0000nishes watching television,\n","he places the remote back on the TV stand, arranges the pillows on thecouch, and folds the blanket. When he leaves his car, he throws any trash\n","away. Whenever he takes a shower, he wipes down the toilet while the\n","shower is warming up. (As he notes, the “perfect time to clean the toilet is\n","right before you wash yourself in the shower anyway.”) e purpose of\n","resetting each room is not simply to clean up aer the last action, but to\n","prepare for the next action.\n","“When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols wrote.\n","“Because I do this every day in every room, stuﬀ always stays in good\n","shape. . . . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy. I’m just\n","proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.”\n","Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming\n","it to make the next action easy. For instance, my wife keeps a box of greeting\n","cards that are presorted by occasion—birthday, sympathy, wedding,\n","graduation, and more. Whenever necessary, she grabs an appropriate card\n","and sends it oﬀ. She is incredibly good at remembering to send cards\n","because she has reduced the friction of doing so. For years, I was the\n","opposite. Someone would have a baby and I would think, “I should send a\n","card.” But then weeks would pass and by the time I remembered to pick one\n","up at the store, it was too late. e habit wasn’t easy.\n","ere are many ways to prime your environment so it’s ready for\n","immediate use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet on\n","the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out any plates and\n","utensils you’ll need the night before. When you wake up, making breakfast\n","will be easy.\n","Want to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing\n","tools on top of your desk, within easy reach.\n","Want to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and\n","water bottle ahead of time.\n","Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables on\n","weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to\n","healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.\n","ese are simple ways to make the good habit the path of least resistance.You can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make\n","bad behaviors diﬃcult. If you \u0000nd yourself watching too much television, for\n","example, then unplug it aer each use. Only plug it back in if you can say\n","out loud the name of the show you want to watch. is setup creates just\n","enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.\n","If that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further. Unplug the television\n","and take the batteries out of the remote aer each use, so it takes an extra\n","ten seconds to turn it back on. And if you’re really hard-core, move the\n","television out of the living room and into a closet aer each use. You can be\n","sure you’ll only take it out when you really want to watch something. e\n","greater the friction, the less likely the habit.\n","Whenever possible, I leave my phone in a diﬀerent room until lunch.\n","When it’s right next to me, I’ll check it all morning for no reason at all. But\n","when it is in another room, I rarely think about it. And the friction is high\n","enough that I won’t go get it without a reason. As a result, I get three to four\n","hours each morning when I can work without interruption.\n","If sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like enough, tell a\n","friend or family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask a coworker\n","to keep it at their desk in the morning and give it back to you at lunch.\n","It is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwanted\n","behavior. When I hide beer in the back of the fridge where I can’t see it, I\n","drink less. When I delete social media apps from my phone, it can be weeks\n","before I download them again and log in. ese tricks are unlikely to curb a\n","true addiction, but for many of us, a little bit of friction can be the diﬀerence\n","between sticking with a good habit or sliding into a bad one. Imagine the\n","cumulative impact of making dozens of these changes and living in an\n","environment designed to make the good behaviors easier and the bad\n","behaviors harder.\n","Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a parent,\n","a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same question: “How can\n","we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” Redesign your life so\n","the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do.\n","Chapter SummaryHuman behavior follows the Law of Least Eﬀort.

In 1992, she was awarded a\n","MacArthur Fellowship, oen referred to as the Genius Grant, and she has\n","spent the bulk of her career touring the globe to perform her original works.\n","She also credits much of her success to simple daily habits.\n","“I begin each day of my life with a ritual,” she writes. “I wake up at 5:30\n","A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweat shirt, and my\n","hat. I walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to\n","take me to the Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and First Avenue, where I\n","work out for two hours.\n","“e ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body\n","through each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. e moment I tell\n","the driver where to go I have completed the ritual.\n","“It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning habitualizes it\n","—makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance that I would skip it\n","or do it diﬀerently. It is one more item in my arsenal of routines, and one\n","less thing to think about.”\n","Hailing a cab each morning may be a tiny action, but it is a splendid\n","example of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.\n","Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given\n","day are done out of habit. is is already a substantial percentage, but thetrue in\u0000uence of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest.\n","Habits are automatic choices that in\u0000uence the conscious decisions that\n","follow. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also\n","shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours aerward.\n","Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. ey lead you down a\n","path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It\n","seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing\n","something diﬀerent. You sit through a bad movie for two hours. You keep\n","snacking even when you’re already full. You check your phone for “just a\n","second” and soon you have spent twenty minutes staring at the screen. In\n","this way, the habits you follow without thinking oen determine the choices\n","you make when you are thinking.\n","Each evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—that\n","shapes the rest of my night.

Everything that follows—driving\n","to the gym, deciding which exercises to do, stepping under the bar—is easy\n","once I’ve taken the \u0000rst step.\n","Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized\n","impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments. e moment you\n","decide between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. e moment you\n","choose between driving your car or riding your bike. e moment you\n","decide between starting your homework or grabbing the video game\n","controller. ese choices are a fork in the road.\n","DECISIVE MOMENTSFIGURE 14: The difference between a good day and a bad day\n","is often a few productive and healthy choices made at decisive\n","moments.

For\n","instance, walking into a restaurant is a decisive moment because it\n","determines what you’ll be eating for lunch. Technically, you are in control of\n","what you order, but in a larger sense, you can only order an item if it is on\n","the menu. If you walk into a steakhouse, you can get a sirloin or a rib eye,\n","but not sushi.

Each day is made up\n","of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that determine the\n","path you take. ese little choices stack up, each one setting the trajectory\n","for how you spend the next chunk of time.\n","Habits are the entry point, not the end point. ey are the cab, not the\n","gym.\n","THE TWO-MINUTE RULE\n","Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big. When\n","you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you\n","end up trying to do too much too soon. e most eﬀective way I know to\n","counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When\n","you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”\n","You’ll \u0000nd that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute\n","version:\n","“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”\n","“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”\n","“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”\n","“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”\n","“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”\n","e idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can\n","meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away.\n","And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once\n","you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A\n","new habit should not feel like a challenge. e actions that follow can be\n","challenging, but the \u0000rst two minutes should be easy. What you want is a\n","“gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path.\n","You can usually \u0000gure out the gateway habits that will lead to your\n","desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to\n","“very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is\n","hard. Walking ten thousand steps is moderately diﬃcult. Walking tenminutes is easy. And putting on your running shoes is very easy. Your goal\n","might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your\n","running shoes. at’s how you follow the Two-Minute Rule.\n","V e r y  e a s y E a s y M o d e r a t e H a r d V e r y  h a r d\n","Put on your\n","running shoesWalk ten\n","minutesWalk ten\n","thousand\n","stepsRun a 5KRun a\n","marathon\n","Write one\n","sentenceWrite one\n","paragraphWrite one\n","thousand\n","wordsWrite a five-\n","thousand-word\n","articleWrite a\n","book\n","Open your\n","notesStudy for\n","ten minutesStudy for three\n","hoursGet straight A’sEarn a\n","PhD\n","People oen think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or\n","meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to\n","do one thing. e point is to master the habit of showing up. e truth is, a\n","habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the\n","basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the \u0000ner\n","details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the\n","easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you\n","can optimize.\n","As you master the art of showing up, the \u0000rst two minutes simply become\n","a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. is is not merely a hack to\n","make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a diﬃcult skill. e\n","more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes\n","that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great\n","things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it\n","easier to get into a state of peak performance. By following the same creative\n","ritual, you make it easier to get into the hard work of creating. By developing\n","a consistent power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a\n","reasonable time each night. You may not be able to automate the whole\n","process, but you can make the \u0000rst action mindless. Make it easy to start and\n","the rest will follow.e Two-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. You know\n","that the real goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it may feel like\n","you’re trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring to read one page\n","or do one push-up or open their notes. And if you know it’s a mental trick,\n","why would you fall for it?\n","If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes and\n","then stop. Go for a run, but you must stop aer two minutes. Start\n","meditating, but you must stop aer two minutes. Study Arabic, but you must\n","stop aer two minutes. It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the whole thing.\n","Your habit can only last one hundred and twenty seconds.\n","One of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred pounds. In\n","the beginning, he went to the gym each day, but he told himself he wasn’t\n","allowed to stay for more than \u0000ve minutes. He would go to the gym, exercise\n","for \u0000ve minutes, and leave as soon as his time was up. Aer a few weeks, he\n","looked around and thought, “Well, I’m always coming here anyway. I might\n","as well start staying a little longer.” A few years later, the weight was gone.\n","Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can bene\u0000t from\n","getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most people give\n","up aer a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore.*\n","e secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. Greg\n","McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily\n","journaling habit by speci\u0000cally writing less than he felt like. He always\n","stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway\n","believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “e best way is to always\n","stop when you are going good,” he said.\n","Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the\n","identity you want to build. If you show up at the gym \u0000ve days in a row—\n","even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new identity.\n","You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on becoming the\n","type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking the smallest action\n","that con\u0000rms the type of person you want to be.\n","We rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by\n","the end goal. But one push-up is better than not exercising. One minute of\n","guitar practice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is better\n","than never picking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to\n","do nothing at all.At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up\n","each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call\n","habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start by\n","mastering the \u0000rst two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. en,\n","advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process—focusing on just the\n","\u0000rst two minutes and mastering that stage before moving on to the next\n","level.

But instead of writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects,\n","entertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated, Hugo’s publisher\n","responded by setting a deadline less than six months away. e book had to\n","be \u0000nished by February 1831.\n","Hugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected\n","all of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a large chest.\n","He was le with nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any suitable\n","clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously\n","during the fall and winter of 1830. e Hunchback of Notre Dame was\n","published two weeks early on January 14, 1831.*\n","Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about\n","making bad habits hard. is is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior\n","Change: make it diﬃcult. If you \u0000nd yourself continually struggling to follow\n","through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and\n","make your bad habits more diﬃcult by creating what psychologists call a\n","commitment device.\n","A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls\n","your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to\n","good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut hisclothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment\n","device.*\n","ere are many ways to create a commitment device. You can reduce\n","overeating by purchasing food in individual packages rather than in bulk\n","size. You can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list at casinos and\n","online poker sites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of\n","athletes who have to “make weight” for a competition choosing to leave their\n","wallets at home during the week before weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to\n","buy fast food.\n","As another example, my friend and fellow habits expert Nir Eyal\n","purchased an outlet timer, which is an adapter that he plugged in between\n","his internet router and the power outlet. At 10 p.m. each night, the outlet\n","timer cuts oﬀ the power to the router. When the internet goes oﬀ, everyone\n","knows it is time to go to bed.\n","Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take\n","advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation.\n","Whenever I’m looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the waiter to\n","split my meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If I waited\n","until the meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half,” it would never\n","work.\n","e key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of\n","the good habit than to get started on it. If you’re feeling motivated to get in\n","shape, schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about\n","the business you want to start, email an entrepreneur you respect and set up\n","a consulting call. When the time comes to act, the only way to bail is to\n","cancel the meeting, which requires eﬀort and may cost money.\n","Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in\n","the future by making bad habits diﬃcult in the present. However, we can do\n","even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.\n","HOW T O AUT OMA TE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT\n","AGAIN\n","John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his\n","childhood doing chores on the family farm and working shis at his father’ssawmill. Aer attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio\n","and opened a small supply store for coal miners.\n","It seemed like a good opportunity. e store faced little competition and\n","enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money.\n","at was when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing from him.\n","In the mid-1800s, employee the was a common problem. Receipts were\n","kept in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. ere were\n","no video cameras to review behavior and no soware to track transactions.\n","Unless you were willing to hover over your employees every minute of the\n","day, or to manage all transactions yourself, it was diﬃcult to prevent the.\n","As Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an\n","advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier.\n","Designed by fellow Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the \u0000rst cash register.\n","e machine automatically locked the cash and receipts inside aer each\n","transaction. Patterson bought two for \u0000y dollars each.\n","Employee the at his store vanished overnight. In the next six months,\n","Patterson’s business went from losing money to making $5,000 in pro\u0000t—\n","the equivalent of more than $100,000 today.\n","Patterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed businesses.\n","He bought the rights to Ritty’s invention and opened the National Cash\n","Register Company. Ten years later, National Cash Register had over one\n","thousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of the most\n","successful businesses of its time.\n","e best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase\n","the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. e brilliance of the\n","cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing\n","practically impossible. Rather than trying to change the employees, it made\n","the preferred behavior automatic.\n","Some actions—like installing a cash register—pay oﬀ again and again.\n","ese onetime choices require a little bit of eﬀort up front but create\n","increasing value over time. I’m fascinated by the idea that a single choice can\n","deliver returns again and again, and I surveyed my readers on their favorite\n","onetime actions that lead to better long-term habits. e table on the\n","following page shares some of the most popular answers.\n","I’d wager that if the average person were to simply do half of the onetime\n","actions on this list—even if they didn’t give another thought to their habits—most would \u0000nd themselves living a better life a year from now. ese\n","onetime actions are a straightforward way to employ the 3rd Law of\n","Behavior Change. ey make it easier to sleep well, eat healthy, be\n","productive, save money, and generally live better.\n","O N E T I M E  A C T I O N S  T H A T  L O C K  I N  G O O D  H A B I T S\n","N u t r i t i o n\n","Buy a water filter to clean your drinking water.\n","Use smaller plates to reduce caloric intake.\n","S l e e p\n","Buy a good mattress.\n","Get blackout curtains.\n","Remove your television from your bedroom.\n","P r o d u c t i v i t y\n","Unsubscribe from emails.\n","Turn off notifications and mute group chats.\n","Set your phone to silent.\n","Use email filters to clear up your inbox.\n","Delete games and social media apps on your phone.\n","H a p p i n e s s\n","Get a dog.\n","Move to a friendly, social neighborhood.\n","G e n e r a l  H e a l t h\n","Get vaccinated.\n","Buy good shoes to avoid back pain.\n","Buy a supportive chair or standing desk.\n","F i n a n c e\n","Enroll in an automatic savings plan.\n","Set up automatic bill pay.\n","Cut cable service.\n","Ask service providers to lower your bills.Of course, there are many ways to automate good habits and eliminate\n","bad ones. Typically, they involve putting technology to work for you.\n","Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and\n","complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. It is the most\n","reliable and eﬀective way to guarantee the right behavior.\n","is is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too infrequently to\n","become habitual. ings you have to do monthly or yearly—like rebalancing\n","your investment portfolio—are never repeated frequently enough to become\n","a habit, so they bene\u0000t in particular from technology “remembering” to do\n","them for you.\n","Other examples include:\n","Medicine: Prescriptions can be automatically re\u0000lled.\n","Personal \u0000nance: Employees can save for retirement with an automatic\n","wage deduction.\n","Cooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery shopping.\n","Productivity: Social media browsing can be cut oﬀ with a website\n","blocker.\n","When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your\n","eﬀort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to\n","the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next\n","stage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North\n","Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending the number of\n","operations we can perform without thinking about them.”\n","Of course, the power of technology can work against us as well. Binge-\n","watching becomes a habit because you have to put more eﬀort in to stop\n","looking at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of pressing a button\n","to advance to the next episode, Net\u0000ix or YouTube will autoplay it for you.\n","All you have to do is keep your eyes open.\n","Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your\n","smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have\n","food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get\n","lost in the vast expanse of social media. When the eﬀort required to act on\n","your desires becomes eﬀectively zero, you can \u0000nd yourself slipping intowhatever impulse arises at the moment. e downside of automation is that\n","we can \u0000nd ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making\n","time for more diﬃcult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.\n","I oen \u0000nd myself gravitating toward social media during any downtime.\n","If I feel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to\n","write oﬀ these minor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time they\n","can accumulate into a serious issue. e constant tug of “just one more\n","minute” can prevent me from doing anything of consequence.

What could you do with an extra six hundred hours per year?)\n","During the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new time\n","management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset the\n","passwords on all my social media accounts, which logged me out on each\n","device. All week I worked without distraction.

(If you don’t\n","have an assistant, team up with a friend or family member and reset each\n","other’s passwords each week.)\n","One of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted. Within the \u0000rst\n","week of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t need to\n","check it nearly as oen as I had been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day.\n","It had simply been so easy that it had become the default.

By 1998, over\n","nine million people called it home. It was the economic center of Pakistan\n","and a transportation hub, with some of the most active airports and seaports\n","in the region. In the commercial parts of town, you could \u0000nd all of the\n","standard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets. But Karachi was\n","also one of the least livable cities in the world.\n","Over 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter settlements and\n","slums. ese densely packed neighborhoods were \u0000lled with makeshi\n","houses cobbled together from old boards, cinder blocks, and other discarded\n","materials. ere was no waste removal system, no electricity grid, no clean\n","water supply. When dry, the streets were a combination of dust and trash.\n","When wet, they became a muddy pit of sewage. Mosquito colonies thrived\n","in pools of stagnant water, and children played among the garbage.\n","e unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease.\n","Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting, and\n","abdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children living there were\n","malnourished. With so many people crammed into such a small space,\n","viruses and bacterial infections spread rapidly. It was this public health crisis\n","that had brought Stephen Luby to Pakistan.Luby and his team realized that in an environment with poor sanitation,\n","the simple habit of washing your hands could make a real diﬀerence in the\n","health of the residents. But they soon discovered that many people were\n","already aware that handwashing was important.\n","And yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing their\n","hands in a haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their hands\n","under the water quickly. Others would only wash one hand. Many would\n","simply forget to wash their hands before preparing food. Everyone said\n","handwashing was important, but few people made a habit out of it. e\n","problem wasn’t knowledge. e problem was consistency.\n","at was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gamble to\n","supply the neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to your standard\n","bar of soap, using Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience.\n","“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told me. “e study\n","participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.” e soap\n","foamed easily, and people were able to lather their hands with suds. It\n","smelled great. Instantly, handwashing became slightly more pleasurable.\n","“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change but as\n","habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a lot easier for people to adopt a product\n","that provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of\n","toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide pleasurable\n","sensory feedback, like \u0000ossing one’s teeth. e marketing team at Procter &\n","Gamble talked about trying to create a positive handwashing experience.”\n","Within months, the researchers saw a rapid shi in the health of children\n","in the neighborhood. e rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent; pneumonia by\n","48 percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.\n","e long-term eﬀects were even better. “We went back to some of the\n","households in Karachi six years aer,” Luby told me. “Over 95 percent of\n","households who had been given the soap for free and encouraged to wash\n","their hands had a handwashing station with soap and water available when\n","our study team visited. . . . We had not given any soap to the intervention\n","group for over \u0000ve years, but during the trial they had become so habituated\n","to wash their hands, that they had maintained the practice.” It was a\n","powerful example of the fourth and \u0000nal Law of Behavior Change: make it\n","satisfying.We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.\n","is is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing\n","your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell\n","the brain: “is feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your\n","brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.\n","Take the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold\n","commercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until Wrigley launched in\n","1891 that it became a worldwide habit. Early versions were made from\n","relatively bland resins—chewy, but not tasty. Wrigley revolutionized the\n","industry by adding \u0000avors like Spearmint and Juicy Fruit, which made the\n","product \u0000avorful and fun to use. en they went a step further and began\n","pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a clean mouth. Advertisements told\n","readers to “Refresh Your Taste.”\n","Tasty \u0000avors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of\n","immediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use.\n","Consumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the largest chewing gum\n","company in the world.\n","Toothpaste had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed great success\n","when they added \u0000avors like spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their\n","products. ese \u0000avors don’t improve the eﬀectiveness of toothpaste. ey\n","simply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the experience of brushing your\n","teeth more pleasurable. My wife actually stopped using Sensodyne because\n","she didn’t like the aertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint\n","\u0000avor, which proved to be more satisfying.\n","Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to\n","repeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a\n","narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time\n","with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he\n","was around. Within a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he\n","found her so uninteresting.\n","Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change:\n","What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to\n","do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished\n","for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions\n","destroy them.e \u0000rst three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it\n","attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be\n","performed this time. e fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying\n","—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes\n","the habit loop.\n","But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction.\n","We are looking for immediate satisfaction.\n","THE MISMA TCH BETWEEN IMMEDIA TE AND DELA YED\n","REW ARDS\n","Imagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of Africa—a giraﬀe or an\n","elephant or a lion. On any given day, most of your decisions have an\n","immediate impact. You are always thinking about what to eat or where to\n","sleep or how to avoid a predator. You are constantly focused on the present\n","or the very near future. You live in what scientists call an immediate-return\n","environment because your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate\n","outcomes.\n","Now switch back to your human self. In modern society, many of the\n","choices you make today will not bene\u0000t you immediately. If you do a good\n","job at work, you’ll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today,\n","perhaps you won’t be overweight next year. If you save money now, maybe\n","you’ll have enough for retirement decades from now. You live in what\n","scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years\n","before your actions deliver the intended payoﬀ.\n","e human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment.\n","e earliest remains of modern humans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens,\n","are approximately two hundred thousand years old. ese were the \u0000rst\n","humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the\n","neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for\n","higher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred\n","thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same\n","hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.\n","It is only recently—during the last \u0000ve hundred years or so—that society\n","has shied to a predominantly delayed-return environment.* Compared tothe age of the brain, modern society is brand-new. In the last one hundred\n","years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the\n","personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé. e world\n","has changed much in recent years, but human nature has changed little.\n","Similar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestors spent\n","their days responding to grave threats, securing the next meal, and taking\n","shelter from a storm. It made sense to place a high value on instant\n","grati\u0000cation. e distant future was less of a concern. And aer thousands of\n","generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved to\n","prefer quick payoﬀs to long-term ones.\n","Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. at\n","is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.* You\n","value the present more than the future. Usually, this tendency serves us well.\n","A reward that is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is\n","merely possible in the future. But occasionally, our bias toward instant\n","grati\u0000cation causes problems.\n","Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung\n","cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk\n","of obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result in\n","sexually transmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain prioritizes\n","rewards, the answers become clear: the consequences of bad habits are\n","delayed while the rewards are immediate. Smoking might kill you in ten\n","years, but it reduces stress and eases your nicotine cravings now. Overeating\n","is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the moment. Sex—safe or not—\n","provides pleasure right away. Disease and infection won’t show up for days\n","or weeks, even years.\n","Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately,\n","these outcomes are oen misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate\n","outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good\n","habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the\n","ultimate outcome feels good. e French economist Frédéric Bastiat\n","explained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always happens that\n","when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are\n","disastrous, and vice versa. . . . Oen, the sweeter the \u0000rst fruit of a habit, the\n","more bitter are its later fruits.”Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. e\n","costs of your bad habits are in the future.\n","e brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t\n","rely on good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight, write a\n","book, or learn a language—you are actually making plans for your future\n","self. And when you envision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to\n","see the value in taking actions with long-term bene\u0000ts. We all want better\n","lives for our future selves. However, when the moment of decision arrives,\n","instant grati\u0000cation usually wins. You are no longer making a choice for\n","Future You, who dreams of being \u0000tter or wealthier or happier. You are\n","choosing for Present You, who wants to be full, pampered, and entertained.\n","As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the\n","more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term\n","goals.*\n","With a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat some\n","behaviors and avoid others, let’s update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior\n","Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately\n","punished is avoided.\n","Our preference for instant grati\u0000cation reveals an important truth about\n","success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing\n","quick hits of satisfaction. e road less traveled is the road of delayed\n","grati\u0000cation. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less\n","competition and oen get a bigger payoﬀ. As the saying goes, the last mile is\n","always the least crowded.\n","is is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at\n","delaying grati\u0000cation have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance\n","abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior\n","social skills. We’ve all seen this play out in our own lives. If you delay\n","watching television and get your homework done, you’ll generally learn\n","more and get better grades. If you don’t buy desserts and chips at the store,\n","you’ll oen eat healthier food when you get home. At some point, success in\n","nearly every \u0000eld requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a\n","delayed reward.\n","Here’s the problem: most people know that delaying grati\u0000cation is the\n","wise approach. ey want the bene\u0000ts of good habits: to be healthy,\n","productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at thedecisive moment. ankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay\n","grati\u0000cation—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not\n","against it. e best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure\n","to the habits that pay oﬀ in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to\n","ones that don’t.\n","HOW T O TURN INST ANT GRA TIFICA TION T O YOUR\n","ADV ANT AGE\n","e vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a\n","small way. e feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid oﬀ and that\n","the work was worth the eﬀort.\n","In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the\n","real world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only aer they have provided\n","you with something. Early on, it’s all sacri\u0000ce. You’ve gone to the gym a few\n","times, but you’re not stronger or \u0000tter or faster—at least, not in any\n","noticeable sense. It’s only months later, once you shed a few pounds or your\n","arms gain some de\u0000nition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its own\n","sake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stay on track. is is why\n","immediate rewards are essential. ey keep you excited while the delayed\n","rewards accumulate in the background.\n","What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate\n","rewards—is the ending of a behavior. e ending of any experience is vital\n","because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the\n","ending of your habit to be satisfying. e best approach is to use\n","reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to\n","increase the rate of a behavior. Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter\n","5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start.\n","Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it\n","satisfying when you \u0000nish.\n","Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with\n","habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be\n","challenging to stick with habits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol\n","this month” because nothing happens when you skip happy hour drinks or\n","don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel satis\u0000ed when there is noaction in the \u0000rst place. All you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there\n","isn’t much satisfying about that.\n","One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make\n","avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you\n","want—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the\n","same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer\n","$5. Pass on another month of Net\u0000ix? Move $10 over. It’s like creating a\n","loyalty program for yourself. e immediate reward of seeing yourself save\n","money toward the leather jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You\n","are making it satisfying to do nothing.\n","One of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. ey wanted to stop\n","eating out so much and start cooking together more. ey labeled their\n","savings account “Trip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat,\n","they transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year, they put the\n","money toward the vacation.\n","It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that\n","reinforce your identity rather than ones that con\u0000ict with it. Buying a new\n","jacket is \u0000ne if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t\n","work if you’re trying to budget and save money. Instead, taking a bubble\n","bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples of rewarding yourself\n","with free time, which aligns with your ultimate goal of more freedom and\n","\u0000nancial independence. Similarly, if your reward for exercising is eating a\n","bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for con\u0000icting identities, and it\n","ends up being a wash. Instead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is\n","both a luxury and a vote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-\n","term reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person.\n","Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and\n","reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the\n","secondary reward. e identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it\n","because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. e more a habit\n","becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow\n","through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.\n","at said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new identity\n","to emerge. Immediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in the short\n","term while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of\n","reinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a\n","refreshing mint \u0000avor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can oﬀer the\n","immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is\n","enjoyable.\n","Chapter Summary\n","e 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.\n","We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is\n","satisfying.\n","e human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed\n","rewards.\n","e Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded\n","is repeated.

Abbotsford was a relatively small\n","suburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most of the\n","big business deals were being made. Given the location, and the fact that\n","Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. But he made\n","brisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit.\n","Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was \u0000lled\n","with 120 paper clips. e other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day,\n","he would make a sales call. Immediately aer, he would move one paper clip\n","from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again. “Every\n","morning I would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I would keep\n","dialing the phone until I had moved them all to the second jar,” he told me.\n","Within eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the \u0000rm.\n","By age twenty-four, he was making $75,000 per year—the equivalent of\n","$125,000 today. Not long aer, he landed a six-\u0000gure job with another\n","company.\n","I like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over the\n","years, I’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of ways.\n","One woman shied a hairpin from one container to another whenever she\n","wrote a page of her book. Another man moved a marble from one bin to the\n","next aer each set of push-ups.Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper\n","clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a\n","result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate\n","satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes in many forms: food\n","journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a soware\n","download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to\n","measure your progress is with a habit tracker.\n","HOW T O KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK\n","A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. e\n","most basic format is to get a calendar and cross oﬀ each day you stick with\n","your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and\n","Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes\n","a record of your habit streak.\n","Countless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most famous\n","was Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklin carried a small\n","booklet everywhere he went and used it to track thirteen personal virtues.\n","is list included goals like “Lose no time. Be always employed in something\n","useful” and “Avoid tri\u0000ing conversation.” At the end of each day, Franklin\n","would open his booklet and record his progress.\n","Jerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak of\n","writing jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his goal is\n","simply to “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. In other words,\n","he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or how inspired he\n","feels. He is simply focused on showing up and adding to his streak.\n","“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of\n","sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the\n","chain of workouts and you’ll get \u0000t faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the\n","chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio.\n","Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior\n","Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and\n","satisfying.\n","Let’s break down each one.Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.\n","Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one.\n","Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on\n","your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the\n","calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. Research has\n","shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight,\n","quitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve\n","than those who don’t. One study of more than sixteen hundred people found\n","that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who\n","did not. e mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.\n","Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of\n","our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement oﬀers\n","one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s\n","really going on each day. One glance at the paper clips in the container and\n","you immediately know how much work you have (or haven’t) been putting\n","in. When the evidence is right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to\n","yourself.\n","Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.\n","e most eﬀective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that\n","we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that\n","path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive eﬀect on motivation.\n","Each small win feeds your desire.\n","is can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling\n","down, it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made. Habit\n","tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder of how\n","far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can motivate\n","you to get started because you don’t want to lose your progress by breaking\n","the streak.\n","Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.is is the most crucial bene\u0000t of all. Tracking can become its own form of\n","reward. It is satisfying to cross an item oﬀ your to-do list, to complete an\n","entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to\n","watch your results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of\n","your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to\n","endure.\n","Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the\n","process rather than the result. You’re not \u0000xated on getting six-pack abs,\n","you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who\n","doesn’t miss workouts.\n","In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you\n","to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are\n","making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you\n","record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit\n","tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of\n","person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and\n","intrinsic grati\u0000cation.*\n","You may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have I waited\n","so long to talk about it?\n","Despite all the bene\u0000ts, I’ve le this discussion until now for a simple\n","reason: many people resist the idea of tracking and measuring. It can feel\n","like a burden because it forces you into two habits: the habit you’re trying to\n","build and the habit of tracking it. Counting calories sounds like a hassle\n","when you’re already struggling to follow a diet. Writing down every sales\n","call seems tedious when you’ve got work to do. It feels easier to say, “I’ll just\n","eat less.” Or, “I’ll try harder.” Or, “I’ll remember to do it.” People inevitably\n","tell me things like, “I have a decision journal, but I wish I used it more.” Or,\n","“I recorded my workouts for a week, but then quit.” I’ve been there myself. I\n","once made a food log to track my calories. I managed to do it for one meal\n","and then gave up.\n","Tracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your entire\n","life. But nearly anyone can bene\u0000t from it in some form—even if it’s only\n","temporary.\n","What can we do to make tracking easier?\n","First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. You’ll\n","probably be surprised by how much you’re already tracking withoutknowing it. Your credit card statement tracks how oen you go out to eat.\n","Your Fitbit registers how many steps you take and how long you sleep. Your\n","calendar records how many new places you travel to each year. Once you\n","know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar to review it each\n","week or each month, which is more practical than tracking it every day.\n","Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important\n","habits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track\n","ten.\n","Finally, record each measurement immediately aer the habit occurs. e\n","completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. is approach allows\n","you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with\n","habit tracking.\n","e habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:\n","Aer [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].\n","Aer I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper clip\n","over.\n","Aer I \u0000nish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout journal.\n","Aer I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I ate.\n","ese tactics can make tracking your habits easier. Even if you aren’t the\n","type of person who enjoys recording your behavior, I think you’ll \u0000nd a few\n","weeks of measurements to be insightful. It’s always interesting to see how\n","you’ve actually been spending your time.\n","at said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more important\n","than any single measurement, is having a good plan for when your habits\n","slide oﬀ track.\n","HOW T O RECOVER QUICKL Y WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK\n","DOWN\n","No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life\n","will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before long, anemergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel for work or your\n","family needs a little more of your time.\n","Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule:\n","never miss twice.\n","If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing\n","one workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row. Maybe I’ll eat\n","an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I can’t be perfect, but\n","I can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, I get started on the\n","next one.\n","e \u0000rst mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of\n","repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is\n","the start of a new habit.\n","is is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can\n","have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when\n","successful people fail, they rebound quickly. e breaking of a habit doesn’t\n","matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.\n","I think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’t do a\n","habit as well or as completely as I would like. Too oen, we fall into an all-\n","or-nothing cycle with our habits. e problem is not slipping up; the\n","problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you\n","shouldn’t do it at all.\n","You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy)\n","days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start\n","with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a\n","33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33\n","percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie\n","Munger says, “e \u0000rst rule of compounding: Never interrupt it\n","unnecessarily.”\n","is is why the “bad” workouts are oen the most important ones.\n","Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued\n","from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, \u0000ve sprints,\n","a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat\n","into your compounding.\n","Furthermore, it’s not always about what happens during the workout. It’s\n","about being the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. It’s easy to train\n","when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for \u0000ve minutes may\n","not improve your performance, but it reaﬃrms your identity.\n","e all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that can\n","derail your habits. Another potential danger—especially if you are using a\n","habit tracker—is measuring the wrong thing.\n","KNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) T O TRACK A HABIT\n","Say you’re running a restaurant and you want to know if your chef is doing a\n","good job. One way to measure success is to track how many customers pay\n","for a meal each day. If more customers come in, the food must be good. If\n","fewer customers come in, something must be wrong.\n","However, this one measurement—daily revenue—only gives a limited\n","picture of what’s really going on. Just because someone pays for a meal\n","doesn’t mean they enjoy the meal. Even dissatis\u0000ed customers are unlikely to\n","dine and dash. In fact, if you’re only measuring revenue, the food might be\n","getting worse but you’re making up for it with marketing or discounts or\n","some other method. Instead, it may be more eﬀective to track how many\n","customers \u0000nish their meal or perhaps the percentage of customers who\n","leave a generous tip.\n","e dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven\n","by the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your success is\n","measured by quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and\n","accounting for quarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a lower\n","number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower number on the scale,\n","even if that means embracing crash diets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills.\n","e human mind wants to “win” whatever game is being played.\n","is pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long\n","hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting\n","ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for\n","standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical\n","thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the\n","wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.\n","is is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named aer the\n","economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measurebecomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only\n","useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it\n","consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall\n","system.\n","In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue\n","anything ephemeral, so, and diﬃcult to quantify. We mistakenly think the\n","factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you\n","can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just\n","because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.\n","All of this to say, it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its proper place. It\n","can feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress, but the\n","measurement is not the only thing that matters. Furthermore, there are\n","many ways to measure progress, and sometimes it helps to shi your focus\n","to something entirely diﬀerent.\n","is is why nonscale victories can be eﬀective for weight loss. e number\n","on the scale may be stubborn, so if you focus solely on that number, your\n","motivation will sag. But you may notice that your skin looks better or you\n","wake up earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of these are valid ways to\n","track your improvement. If you’re not feeling motivated by the number on\n","the scale, perhaps it’s time to focus on a diﬀerent measurement—one that\n","gives you more signals of progress.\n","No matter how you measure your improvement, habit tracking oﬀers a\n","simple way to make your habits more satisfying. Each measurement\n","provides a little bit of evidence that you’re moving in the right direction and\n","a brief moment of immediate pleasure for a job well done.\n","Chapter Summary\n","One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.\n","A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—\n","like marking an X on a calendar.\n","Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your\n","habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.\n","Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as\n","quickly as possible.\n","Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most\n","important thing.A\n","17\n","How an Accountability Partner Can\n","Change Everything\n","FTER SERVING AS a pilot in World War II, Roger Fisher attended Harvard\n","Law School and spent thirty-four years specializing in negotiation and\n","con\u0000ict management. He founded the Harvard Negotiation Project and\n","worked with numerous countries and world leaders on peace resolutions,\n","hostage crises, and diplomatic compromises. But it was in the 1970s and\n","1980s, as the threat of nuclear war escalated, that Fisher developed perhaps\n","his most interesting idea.\n","At the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that could prevent\n","nuclear war, and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sitting president would\n","have access to launch codes that could kill millions of people but would\n","never actually see anyone die because he would always be thousands of\n","miles away.\n","“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that [nuclear]\n","code number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to\n","the heart of a volunteer. e volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy\n","butcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted\n","to \u0000re nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him \u0000rst,\n","with his own hands, to kill one human being. e President says, ‘George,\n","I’m sorry but tens of millions must die.’ He has to look at someone and\n","realize what death is—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House\n","carpet. It’s reality brought home.“When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, ‘My God,\n","that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s\n","judgment. He might never push the button.’”\n","roughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change we have\n","covered the importance of making good habits immediately satisfying.\n","Fisher’s proposal is an inversion of the 4th Law: Make it immediately\n","unsatisfying.\n","Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is\n","satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is\n","painful. Pain is an eﬀective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets \u0000xed. If a\n","failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. e more immediate and more\n","costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. e threat of a bad\n","review forces a plumber to be good at his job. e possibility of a customer\n","never returning makes restaurants create good food. e cost of cutting the\n","wrong blood vessel makes a surgeon master human anatomy and cut\n","carefully. When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly.\n","e more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to\n","prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an\n","instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.\n","We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes\n","them hard to abandon. e best way I know to overcome this predicament is\n","to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. ere\n","can’t be a gap between the action and the consequences.\n","As soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior begins to\n","change. Customers pay their bills on time when they are charged a late fee.\n","Students show up to class when their grade is linked to attendance. We’ll\n","jump through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate pain.\n","ere is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely on punishment to\n","change behavior, then the strength of the punishment must match the\n","relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. To be productive, the\n","cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action. To be healthy,\n","the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise. Getting \u0000ned\n","for smoking in a restaurant or failing to recycle adds consequence to an\n","action. Behavior only shis if the punishment is painful enough and reliably\n","enforced.In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the\n","consequence, the more likely it is to in\u0000uence individual behavior. e more\n","global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to\n","in\u0000uence individual behavior.\n","ankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost to\n","any bad habit: create a habit contract.\n","THE HABIT CONTRACT\n","e \u0000rst seat belt law was passed in New York on December 1, 1984. At the\n","time, just 14 percent of people in the United States regularly wore a seat belt\n","—but that was all about to change.\n","Within \u0000ve years, over half of the nation had seat belt laws. Today,\n","wearing a seat belt is enforceable by law in forty-nine of the \u0000y states. And\n","it’s not just the legislation, the number of people wearing seat belts has\n","changed dramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of Americans buckled\n","up each time they got in a car. In just over thirty years, there was a complete\n","reversal in the habits of millions of people.\n","Laws and regulations are an example of how government can change our\n","habits by creating a social contract. As a society, we collectively agree to\n","abide by certain rules and then enforce them as a group. Whenever a new\n","piece of legislation impacts behavior—seat belt laws, banning smoking\n","inside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an example of a social\n","contract shaping our habits. e group agrees to act in a certain way, and if\n","you don’t follow along, you’ll be punished.\n","Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create\n","a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or\n","written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit\n","and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. en you\n","\u0000nd one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign oﬀ on\n","the contract with you.\n","Bryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, Tennessee, was the \u0000rst\n","person I saw put this strategy into action. Shortly aer the birth of his son,\n","Harris realized he wanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit\n","contract between himself, his wife, and his personal trainer. e \u0000rst versionread, “Bryan’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eating correctly again so\n","he feels better, looks better, and is able to hit his long-term goal of 200\n","pounds at 10% body fat.”\n","Below that statement, Harris laid out a road map for achieving his ideal\n","outcome:\n","Phase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.\n","Phase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking program in Q2.\n","Phase #3: Re\u0000ne and maintain the details of his diet and workout\n","program in Q3.\n","Finally, he wrote out each of the daily habits that would get him to his\n","goal. For example, “Write down all food that he consumes each day and\n","weigh himself each day.”\n","And then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan doesn’t do these\n","two items then the following consequence will be enforced: He will have to\n","dress up each workday and each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter.\n","Dress up is de\u0000ned as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or shorts. He will\n","also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as he sees \u0000t if he misses one day of\n","logging food.”\n","At the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all signed the\n","contract.\n","My initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly formal and\n","unnecessary, especially the signatures. But Harris convinced me that signing\n","the contract was an indication of seriousness. “Anytime I skip this part,” he\n","said, “I start slacking almost immediately.”\n","ree months later, aer hitting his targets for Q1, Harris upgraded his\n","goals. e consequences escalated, too. If he missed his carbohydrate and\n","protein targets, he had to pay his trainer $100. And if he failed to weigh\n","himself, he had to give his wife $500 to use as she saw \u0000t. Perhaps most\n","painfully, if he forgot to run sprints, he had to dress up for work every day\n","and wear an Alabama hat the rest of the quarter—the bitter rival of his\n","beloved Auburn team.\n","e strategy worked. With his wife and trainer acting as accountability\n","partners and with the habit contract clarifying exactly what to do each day,Harris lost the weight.*\n","To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them\n","painful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward way to\n","do exactly that.\n","Even if you don’t want to create a full-blown habit contract, simply\n","having an accountability partner is useful. e comedian Margaret Cho\n","writes a joke or song every day. She does the “song a day” challenge with a\n","friend, which helps them both stay accountable. Knowing that someone is\n","watching can be a powerful motivator. You are less likely to procrastinate or\n","give up because there is an immediate cost. If you don’t follow through,\n","perhaps they’ll see you as untrustworthy or lazy. Suddenly, you are not only\n","failing to uphold your promises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your\n","promises to others.\n","You can even automate this process. omas Frank, an entrepreneur in\n","Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’t, he has\n","a tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because\n","I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t\n","malfunction.”\n","We are always trying to present our best selves to the world. We comb\n","our hair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully because we know\n","these habits are likely to get a positive reaction. We want to get good grades\n","and graduate from top schools to impress potential employers and mates\n","and our friends and family. We care about the opinions of those around us\n","because it helps if others like us. is is precisely why getting an\n","accountability partner or signing a habit contract can work so well.\n","Chapter Summary\n","e inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it\n","unsatisfying.\n","We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.\n","An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We\n","care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to\n","have a lesser opinion of us.A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It\n","makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.\n","Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful\n","motivator.\n","H O W  T O  C R E A T E  A  G O O D  H A B I T\n","T h e  1 s t  L a w :  M a k e  I t  O b v i o u s\n","1 . 1 : Fill out the Habits Scorecard.

Phelps has won more\n","Olympic medals not only than any swimmer but also more than any\n","Olympian in any sport.\n","Fewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was a fantastic\n","athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner who holds two\n","Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-distance runners of\n","all time. For many years, he held the world record in the mile, 1,500-meter,\n","and 2,000-meter races. At the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he\n","won gold in the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter races.\n","ese two athletes are wildly diﬀerent in many ways. (For starters, one\n","competed on land and the other in water.) But most notably, they diﬀer\n","signi\u0000cantly in height. El Guerrouj is \u0000ve feet, nine inches tall. Phelps is six\n","feet, four inches tall. Despite this seven-inch diﬀerence in height, the two\n","men are identical in one respect: Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj\n","wear the same length inseam on their pants.\n","How is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for his height and a\n","very long torso, the perfect build for swimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly\n","long legs and a short upper body, an ideal frame for distance running.\n","Now, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch sports. Given\n","his remarkable athleticism, could Michael Phelps become an Olympic-caliber distance runner with enough training? It’s unlikely. At peak \u0000tness,\n","Phelps weighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier than El Guerrouj,\n","who competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. Taller runners are heavier\n","runners, and every extra pound is a curse when it comes to distance\n","running. Against elite competition, Phelps would be doomed from the start.\n","Similarly, El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in history, but it’s\n","doubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer. Since 1976,\n","the average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is\n","\u0000ve feet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of Olympic gold\n","medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle swim is six feet, four inches.\n","Swimmers tend to be tall and have long backs and arms, which are ideal for\n","pulling through the water. El Guerrouj would be at a severe disadvantage\n","before he ever touched the pool.\n","e secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right \u0000eld\n","of competition. is is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and\n","business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with,\n","when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael\n","Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a\n","game where the odds are in your favor.\n","Embracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that\n","people are born with diﬀerent abilities. Some people don’t like to discuss this\n","fact. On the surface, your genes seem to be \u0000xed, and it’s no fun to talk\n","about things you cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological determinism\n","makes it sound like certain individuals are destined for success and others\n","doomed to failure. But this is a shortsighted view of the in\u0000uence of genes\n","on behavior.\n","e strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot be easily\n","changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable\n","circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. If\n","you want to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is very useful. If you\n","want to perform a gymnastics routine, being seven feet tall is a great\n","hindrance. Our environment determines the suitability of our genes and the\n","utility of our natural talents. When our environment changes, so do the\n","qualities that determine success.\n","is is true not just for physical characteristics but for mental ones as\n","well. I’m smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior; not so muchwhen it comes to knitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords. Competence\n","is highly dependent on context.\n","e people at the top of any competitive \u0000eld are not only well trained,\n","they are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you want to be truly\n","great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.\n","In short: genes do not determine your destiny. ey determine your areas\n","of opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but\n","they don’t predetermine.” e areas where you are genetically predisposed to\n","success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. e key is\n","to direct your eﬀort toward areas that both excite you and match your\n","natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability.\n","e obvious question is, “How do I \u0000gure out where the odds are in my\n","favor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right for me?”\n","e \u0000rst place we will look for an answer is by understanding your\n","personality.\n","HOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS\n","Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath\n","the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to in\u0000uence\n","everything from the number of hours you spend watching television to your\n","likelihood to marry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs,\n","alcohol, or nicotine. ere’s a strong genetic component to how obedient or\n","rebellious you are when facing authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are\n","to stressful events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how\n","captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending a\n","concert. As Robert Plomin, a behavioral geneticist at King’s College in\n","London, told me, “It is now at the point where we have stopped testing to\n","see if traits have a genetic component because we literally can’t \u0000nd a single\n","one that isn’t in\u0000uenced by our genes.”\n","Bundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to\n","a particular personality. Your personality is the set of characteristics that is\n","consistent from situation to situation. e most proven scienti\u0000c analysis of\n","personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into\n","\u0000ve spectrums of behavior.1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to\n","cautious and consistent on the other.\n","2. Conscientiousness: organized and eﬃcient to easygoing and\n","spontaneous.\n","3. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you\n","likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).\n","4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and\n","detached.\n","5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to con\u0000dent, calm, and stable.\n","All \u0000ve characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion, for\n","instance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise in the\n","nursing ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away. When the\n","researchers tracked these children through life, they found that the babies\n","who turned toward the noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts.\n","ose who turned away were more likely to become introverts.\n","People who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and warm.\n","ey also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays\n","an important role in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can act\n","as a natural antidepressant. You can easily imagine how someone with more\n","oxytocin might be inclined to build habits like writing thank-you notes or\n","organizing social events.\n","As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all\n","people possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend\n","to be anxious and worry more than others. is trait has been linked to\n","hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for\n","noticing threats. In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative\n","cues in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.\n","Our habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there is no\n","doubt that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeply rooted\n","preferences make certain behaviors easier for some people than for others.\n","You don’t have to apologize for these diﬀerences or feel guilty about them,\n","but you do have to work with them. A person who scores lower on\n","conscientiousness, for example, will be less likely to be orderly by nature and\n","may need to rely more heavily on environment design to stick with goodhabits. (As a reminder for the less conscientious readers among us,\n","environment design is a strategy we discussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)\n","e takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your\n","personality.* People can get ripped working out like a bodybuilder, but if\n","you prefer rock climbing or cycling or rowing, then shape your exercise\n","habit around your interests. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you\n","\u0000nd that low-fat works for you, then more power to you. If you want to read\n","more, don’t be embarrassed if you prefer steamy romance novels over\n","non\u0000ction. Read whatever fascinates you.* You don’t have to build the habits\n","everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one\n","that is most popular.\n","ere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction.\n","Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick. is is the core\n","idea behind the 4th Law.\n","Tailoring your habits to your personality is a good start, but this is not\n","the end of the story. Let’s turn our attention to \u0000nding and designing\n","situations where you’re at a natural advantage.\n","HOW T O FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR\n","F A VOR\n","Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for\n","maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy\n","almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that\n","come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be\n","more competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. ey\n","stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed,\n","and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities,\n","which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even\n","higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous cycle.\n","Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a\n","struggle.\n","How do you pick the right habit? e \u0000rst step is something we covered\n","in the 3rd Law: make it easy. In many cases, when people pick the wrong\n","habit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too diﬃcult. When ahabit is easy, you are more likely to be successful. When you are successful,\n","you are more likely to feel satis\u0000ed. However, there is another level to\n","consider. In the long-run, if you continue to advance and improve, any area\n","can become challenging. At some point, you need to make sure you’re\n","playing the right game for your skillset. How do you \u0000gure that out?\n","e most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there’s a\n","problem with this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try every\n","career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musical instrument.\n","ankfully, there is an eﬀective way to manage this conundrum, and it is\n","known as the explore/exploit trade-oﬀ.\n","In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of\n","exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the\n","liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. e goal is to try out many\n","possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.\n","Aer this initial period of exploration, shi your focus to the best\n","solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. e proper\n","balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently\n","winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you\n","continue to explore, explore, explore.\n","In the long-run it is probably most eﬀective to work on the strategy that\n","seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep\n","exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks\n","employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their oﬃcial job and 20\n","percent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of\n","blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.\n","e optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. If you\n","have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career—it makes\n","more sense to explore because once you \u0000nd the right thing, you still have a\n","good amount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for time—say, as you\n","come up on the deadline for a project—you should implement the best\n","solution you’ve found so far and get some results.\n","As you explore diﬀerent options, there are a series of questions you can\n","ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be\n","most satisfying to you:What feels like fun to me, but work to others? e mark of whether\n","you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can\n","handle the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you\n","enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? e work that\n","hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.\n","What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter\n","when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world\n","fades away. is blend of happiness and peak performance is what\n","athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is\n","nearly impossible to experience a \u0000ow state and not \u0000nd the task\n","satisfying at least to some degree.\n","Where do I get greater returns than the average person? We are\n","continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is\n","more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor. When\n","I started writing at jamesclear.com, my email list grew very quickly. I\n","wasn’t quite sure what I was doing well, but I knew that results seemed\n","to be coming faster for me than for some of my colleagues, which\n","motivated me to keep writing.\n","What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you\n","have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others\n","expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me?\n","When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal\n","judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism.\n","Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel\n","authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.\n","To be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and\n","Hicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities that are\n","highly valued by society and to be placed in the ideal environment for those\n","abilities. We all have limited time on this planet, and the truly great amongus are the ones who not only work hard but also have the good fortune to be\n","exposed to opportunities that favor us.\n","But what if you don’t want to leave it up to luck?\n","If you can’t \u0000nd a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create\n","one. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, “Everyone has at least\n","a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some eﬀort. In my\n","case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m\n","not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big,\n","but I’m funnier than most people. e magic is that few people can draw\n","well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so\n","rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic\n","that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.”\n","When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being diﬀerent. By\n","combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it\n","easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for\n","years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win\n","the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that\n","favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.\n","In college, I designed my own major, biomechanics, which was a\n","combination of physics, chemistry, biology, and anatomy. I wasn’t smart\n","enough to stand out among the top physics or biology majors, so I created\n","my own game. And because it suited me—I was only taking the courses I\n","was interested in—studying felt like less of a chore. It was also easier to avoid\n","the trap of comparing myself to everyone else. Aer all, nobody else was\n","taking the same combination of classes, so who could say if they were better\n","or worse?\n","Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad\n","genetics. e more you master a speci\u0000c skill, the harder it becomes for\n","others to compete with you. Many bodybuilders are stronger than the\n","average arm wrestler, but even a massive bodybuilder may lose at arm\n","wrestling because the arm wrestling champ has very speci\u0000c strength. Even\n","if you’re not the most naturally gied, you can oen win by being the best in\n","a very narrow category.\n","Boiling water will soen a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control\n","whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where\n","it’s better to be hard or so. If you can \u0000nd a more favorable environment,you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to\n","one where they are in your favor.\n","HOW T O GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES\n","Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. ey clarify it. ey tell\n","us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to\n","spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look\n","for and which types of challenges to avoid. e better we understand our\n","nature, the better our strategy can be.\n","Biological diﬀerences matter.

Labor laws were loose back\n","then and the boy managed to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50\n","apiece.\n","Within a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he\n","learned tricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokes and\n","tried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved\n","was not performing magic but performing in general. He set his sights on\n","becoming a comedian.\n","Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs\n","around Los Angeles. e crowds were small and his act was short. He was\n","rarely on stage for more than \u0000ve minutes. Most of the people in the crowd\n","were too busy drinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night,\n","he literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty club.\n","It wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting better.\n","His \u0000rst routines would only last one or two minutes. By high school, his\n","material had expanded to include a \u0000ve-minute act and, a few years later, a\n","ten-minute show. At nineteen, he was performing weekly for twenty minutes\n","at a time. He had to read three poems during the show just to make the\n","routine long enough, but his skills continued to progress.He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing. He\n","took a job as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to land his own\n","appearances on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into\n","being a regular guest on e Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live.\n","Finally, aer nearly \u0000een years of work, the young man rose to fame. He\n","toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. en seventy-two cities in eighty days.\n","en eighty-\u0000ve cities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend one show\n","in Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his three-day show in New\n","York. He catapulted to the top of his genre and became one of the most\n","successful comedians of his time.\n","His name is Steve Martin.\n","Martin’s story oﬀers a fascinating perspective on what it takes to stick\n","with habits for the long run. Comedy is not for the timid. It is hard to\n","imagine a situation that would strike fear into the hearts of more people\n","than performing alone on stage and failing to get a single laugh. And yet\n","Steve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen years. In his words, “10\n","years spent learning, 4 years spent re\u0000ning, and 4 years as a wild success.”\n","Why is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their habits—whether\n","practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or playing guitar—while most of us\n","struggle to stay motivated? How do we design habits that pull us in rather\n","than ones that fade away? Scientists have been studying this question for\n","many years. While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent\n","\u0000ndings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of\n","desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable diﬃculty.”\n","e human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal\n","zone of diﬃculty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a\n","four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every\n","point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer\n","or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is\n","too diﬃcult.\n","Now consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As the\n","game progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You have a good\n","chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your focus narrows,\n","distractions fade away, and you \u0000nd yourself fully invested in the task at\n","hand. is is a challenge of just manageable diﬃculty and it is a prime\n","example of the Goldilocks Rule.e Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation\n","when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.\n","Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.\n","THE GOLDILOCKS RULE\n","FIGURE 15: Maximum motivation occurs when facing a\n","challenge of just manageable difficulty. In psychology research\n","this is known as the Yerkes–Dodson law, which describes the\n","optimal level of arousal as the midpoint between boredom and\n","anxiety.\n","Martin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the Goldilocks Rule in\n","practice. Each year, he expanded his comedy routine—but only by a minute\n","or two. He was always adding new material, but he also kept a few jokes that\n","were guaranteed to get laughs. ere were just enough victories to keep him\n","motivated and just enough mistakes to keep him working hard.When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior as\n","easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect.\n","is is an idea we covered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior\n","Change.\n","Once a habit has been established, however, it’s important to continue to\n","advance in small ways. ese little improvements and new challenges keep\n","you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve\n","a \u0000ow state.*\n","A \u0000ow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed\n","in an activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. ey found that\n","to achieve a state of \u0000ow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your\n","current ability. In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the diﬃculty\n","of an action in this way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains:\n","working on challenges of just manageable diﬃculty—something on the\n","perimeter of your ability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.\n","Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for\n","challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough\n","progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for\n","them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And\n","boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.\n","HOW T O ST A Y FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING\n","ON YOUR GOALS\n","Aer my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new sport. I joined a\n","weightliing team and one day an elite coach visited our gym. He had\n","worked with thousands of athletes during his long career, including a few\n","Olympians. I introduced myself and we began talking about the process of\n","improvement.\n","“What’s the diﬀerence between the best athletes and everyone else?” I\n","asked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?”\n","He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But\n","then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to\n","who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lis over\n","and over and over.”His answer surprised me because it’s a diﬀerent way of thinking about\n","work ethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals.\n","Whether it’s business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all\n","comes down to passion.” Or, “You have to really want it.” As a result, many of\n","us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that\n","successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach\n","was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as\n","everyone else. e diﬀerence is that they still \u0000nd a way to show up despite\n","the feelings of boredom.\n","Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the\n","more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been\n","made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it\n","happens even faster than that. All you have to do is hit the gym a few days in\n","a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time and letting one day slip\n","doesn’t feel like much. ings are going well. It’s easy to rationalize taking a\n","day oﬀ because you’re in a good place.\n","e greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored\n","with habits because they stop delighting us. e outcome becomes expected.\n","And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek\n","novelty. Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle,\n","jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to the next, one business\n","idea to the next. As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we\n","begin seeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still working. As\n","Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are\n","doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”\n","Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those\n","that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual\n","novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary novelty.\n","Each of these experiences oﬀer continual elements of surprise.\n","In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.* Slot machines are the\n","most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now\n","and then but not at any predictable interval. e pace of rewards varies. is\n","variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall,\n","and accelerates habit formation.\n","Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward\n","people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope itwill change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings\n","we already experience because they reduce boredom.\n","e sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and\n","failure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you don’t.\n","You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and just enough\n","“wanting” to experience desire. is is one of the bene\u0000ts of following the\n","Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit, working on\n","challenges of just manageable diﬃculty is a good way to keep things\n","interesting.\n","Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you\n","wouldn’t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some\n","of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber only\n","picked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much longer.\n","And if I \u0000ossed my teeth each night and only sometimes ended up with a\n","clean mouth, I think I’d skip it.\n","Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some\n","point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-\n","improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.\n","We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would\n","like to ful\u0000ll, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if\n","you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be\n","consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.\n","I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it,\n","there will be days when you feel like quitting.

In chess, it is only aer the\n","basic movements of the pieces have become automatic that a player can\n","focus on the next level of the game. Each chunk of information that is\n","memorized opens up the mental space for more eﬀortful thinking. is is\n","true for any endeavor. When you know the simple movements so well that\n","you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to\n","more advanced details. In this way, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of\n","excellence.\n","However, the bene\u0000ts of habits come at a cost. At \u0000rst, each repetition\n","develops \u0000uency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic,\n","you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It\n","becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on\n","autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better.\n","e upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. e\n","downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and\n","stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better\n","because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing\n","your current habits—not improving them. In fact, some research has shown\n","that once a skill has been mastered there is usually a slight decline in\n","performance over time.\n","Usually, this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry. You don’t\n","need a system to continuously improve how well you brush your teeth or tieyour shoes or make your morning cup of tea. With habits like these, good\n","enough is usually good enough. e less energy you spend on trivial choices,\n","the more you can spend it on what really matters.\n","However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite\n","levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can’t repeat\n","the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are\n","necessary, but not suﬃcient for mastery. What you need is a combination of\n","automatic habits and deliberate practice.\n","Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\n","To become great, certain skills do need to become automatic. Basketball\n","players need to be able to dribble without thinking before they can move on\n","to mastering layups with their nondominant hand. Surgeons need to repeat\n","the \u0000rst incision so many times that they could do it with their eyes closed,\n","so that they can focus on the hundreds of variables that arise during surgery.\n","But aer one habit has been mastered, you have to return to the eﬀortful\n","part of the work and begin building the next habit.\n","Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of\n","success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this\n","new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your\n","development. Old tasks become easier the second time around, but it doesn’t\n","get easier overall because now you’re pouring your energy into the next\n","challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It’s an endless\n","cycle.\n","MASTERING ONE HABITMASTERING A FIELD\n","FIGURE 16: The process of mastery requires that you\n","progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each\n","habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has\n","been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain\n","conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to re\u0000ne and\n","improve. It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have\n","mastered a skill—right when things are starting to feel automatic and you\n","are becoming comfortable—that you must avoid slipping into the trap of\n","complacency.\n","e solution? Establish a system for re\u0000ection and review.\n","HOW T O REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS\n","In 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talented basketball\n","teams ever assembled, but they are rarely remembered that way. e team\n","started the 1985–1986 NBA season with an astounding 29–5 record. “e\n","pundits were saying that we might be the best team in the history of\n","basketball,” head coach Pat Riley said aer the season. Surprisingly, the\n","Lakers stumbled in the 1986 playoﬀs and suﬀered a season-ending defeat in\n","the Western Conference Finals. e “best team in the history of basketball”\n","didn’t even play for the NBA championship.\n","Aer that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent his\n","players had and about how much promise his team held. He didn’t want to\n","see \u0000ashes of brilliance followed by a gradual fade in performance. He\n","wanted the Lakers to play up to their potential, night aer night. In the\n","summer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that, a system that he called\n","the Career Best Eﬀort program or CBE.\n","“When players \u0000rst join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we track their\n","basketball statistics all the way back to high school. I call this Taking eir\n","Number. We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can do, then build\n","him into our plan for the team, based on the notion that he will maintain\n","and then improve upon his averages.”\n","Aer determining a player’s baseline level of performance, Riley added a\n","key step. He asked each player to “improve their output by at least 1 percent\n","over the course of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE, or\n","Career Best Eﬀort.” Similar to the British Cycling team that we discussed in\n","Chapter 1, the Lakers sought peak performance by getting slightly better\n","each day.Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points or\n","statistics but about giving your “best eﬀort spiritually and mentally and\n","physically.” Players got credit for “allowing an opponent to run into you\n","when you know that a foul will be called against him, diving for loose balls,\n","going aer rebounds whether you are likely to get them or not, helping a\n","teammate when the player he’s guarding has surged past him, and other\n","‘unsung hero’ deeds.”\n","As an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers star player at the\n","time—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5 turnovers in a\n","game. Magic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed by diving aer a loose\n","ball (+1). Finally, he played a total of 33 minutes in this imaginary game.\n","e positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. en, we\n","subtract the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33 minutes\n","played.\n","29/33 = 0.879\n","Magic’s CBE number here would be 879. is number was calculated for\n","all of a player’s games, and it was the average CBE that a player was asked to\n","improve by 1 percent over the season. Riley compared each player’s current\n","CBE to not only their past performances but also those of other players in\n","the league. As Riley put it, “We rank team members alongside league\n","opponents who play the same position and have similar role de\u0000nitions.”\n","Sportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top\n","performers in the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week and\n","measured them against the corresponding players on his own roster. Solid,\n","reliable players generally rated a score in the 600s, while elite players scored\n","at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted 138 triple-doubles in his career,\n","oen scored over 1,000.”\n","e Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by making historical\n","comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “We stacked the month of November\n","1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players whether they were\n","doing better or worse than at the same point last season. en we showed\n","them how their performance \u0000gures for December 1986, stacked up against\n","November’s.”e Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, they\n","were NBA champions. e following year, Pat Riley led his team to another\n","title as the Lakers became the \u0000rst team in twenty years to win back-to-back\n","NBA championships. Aerward, he said, “Sustaining an eﬀort is the most\n","important thing for any enterprise. e way to be successful is to learn how\n","to do things right, then do them the same way every time.”\n","e CBE program is a prime example of the power of re\u0000ection and\n","review. e Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the most out\n","of what they had, and made sure their habits improved rather than declined.\n","Re\u0000ection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits\n","because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider\n","possible paths for improvement. Without re\u0000ection, we can make excuses,\n","create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for\n","determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to\n","yesterday.\n","Top performers in all \u0000elds engage in various types of re\u0000ection and\n","review, and the process doesn’t have to be complex. Kenyan runner Eliud\n","Kipchoge is one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic gold\n","medalist. He still takes notes aer every practice in which he reviews his\n","training for the day and searches for areas that can be improved. Similarly,\n","gold medal swimmer Katie Ledecky records her wellness on a scale of 1 to\n","10 and includes notes on her nutrition and how well she slept. She also\n","records the times posted by other swimmers. At the end of each week, her\n","coach goes over her notes and adds his thoughts.\n","It’s not just athletes, either. When comedian Chris Rock is preparing\n","fresh material, he will \u0000rst appear at small nightclubs dozens of times and\n","test hundreds of jokes. He brings a notepad on stage and records which bits\n","go over well and where he needs to make adjustments. e few killer lines\n","that survive will form the backbone of his new show.\n","I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in\n","which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made\n","them, and what they expect the outcome to be. ey review their choices at\n","the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where\n","they went wrong.*\n","Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about \u0000ne-tuning\n","them. Re\u0000ection and review ensures that you spend your time on the rightthings and make course corrections whenever necessary—like Pat Riley\n","adjusting the eﬀort of his players on a nightly basis. You don’t want to keep\n","practicing a habit if it becomes ineﬀective.\n","Personally, I employ two primary modes of re\u0000ection and review. Each\n","December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I re\u0000ect on the previous\n","year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I\n","published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and\n","more.* en, I re\u0000ect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three\n","questions:\n","1. What went well this year?\n","2. What didn’t go so well this year?\n","3. What did I learn?\n","Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity\n","Report. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps\n","me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use\n","it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living\n","in accordance with them. is is when I re\u0000ect on my identity and how I can\n","work toward being the type of person I wish to become.*\n","My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:\n","1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?\n","2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?\n","3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?\n","ese two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours per year—but\n","they are crucial periods of re\u0000nement. ey prevent the gradual slide that\n","happens when I don’t pay close attention. ey provide an annual reminder\n","to revisit my desired identity and consider how my habits are helping me\n","become the type of person I wish to be. ey indicate when I should\n","upgrade my habits and take on new challenges and when I should dial my\n","eﬀorts back and focus on the fundamentals.Re\u0000ection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful\n","because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily\n","choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can\n","see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. ere is too\n","much feedback. Conversely, never reviewing your habits is like never\n","looking in the mirror. You aren’t aware of easily \u0000xable \u0000aws—a spot on\n","your shirt, a bit of food in your teeth. ere is too little feedback. Periodic\n","re\u0000ection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a\n","conversational distance. You can see the important changes you should\n","make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to view the entire\n","mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley.\n","Finally, re\u0000ection and review oﬀers an ideal time to revisit one of the\n","most important aspects of behavior change: identity.\n","HOW T O BREAK THE BELIEFS THA T HOLD YOU BACK\n","In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your\n","desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same\n","beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working\n","against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to\n","deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. is is one of\n","the greatest downsides of building habits.\n","e more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our\n","identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. You see this\n","in every industry. e schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching\n","methods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. e veteran\n","manager who is committed to doing things “his way.” e surgeon who\n","dismisses the ideas of her younger colleagues. e band who produces a\n","mind-blowing \u0000rst album and then gets stuck in a rut. e tighter we cling\n","to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.\n","One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an\n","overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul\n","Graham, “keep your identity small.” e more you let a single belief de\u0000ne\n","you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie\n","everything up in being the point guard or the partner at the \u0000rm orwhatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life will wreck you. If you’re\n","a vegan and then develop a health condition that forces you to change your\n","diet, you’ll have an identity crisis on your hands. When you cling too tightly\n","to one identity, you become brittle. Lose that one thing and you lose\n","yourself.\n","For most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of my\n","identity. Aer my baseball career ended, I struggled to \u0000nd myself. When\n","you spend your whole life de\u0000ning yourself in one way and that disappears,\n","who are you now?\n","Military veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings. If\n","your identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what\n","happens when your period of service ends? For many business owners, their\n","identity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the founder.”\n","If you have spent every waking moment working on your business, how will\n","you feel aer you sell the company?\n","e key to mitigating these losses of identity is to rede\u0000ne yourself such\n","that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your\n","particular role changes.\n","“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally tough\n","and loves a physical challenge.”\n","“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is\n","disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”\n","“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and\n","creates things.”\n","When chosen eﬀectively, an identity can be \u0000exible rather than brittle.\n","Like water \u0000owing around an obstacle, your identity works with the\n","changing circumstances rather than against them.\n","e following quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideas\n","perfectly:\n","Men are born so and supple;\n","dead, they are stiﬀ and hard.\n","Plants are born tender and pliant;dead, they are brittle and dry.\n","us whoever is stiﬀ and in\u0000exible\n","is a disciple of death.\n","Whoever is so and yielding\n","is a disciple of life.\n","e hard and stiﬀ will be broken.\n","e so and supple will prevail.\n","—LAO TZU\n","Habits deliver numerous bene\u0000ts, but the downside is that they can lock\n","us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world\n","is shiing around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly\n","changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and\n","beliefs are still serving you.\n","A lack of self-awareness is poison. Re\u0000ection and review is the antidote.\n","Chapter Summary\n","e upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. e\n","downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.\n","Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\n","Re\u0000ection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious\n","of your performance over time.\n","e tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow\n","beyond it.TConclusion\n","The Secret to Results That Last\n","HERE IS AN ancient Greek parable known as the Sorites Paradox,* which\n","talks about the eﬀect one small action can have when repeated enough\n","times. One formulation of the paradox goes as follows: Can one coin make a\n","person rich? If you give a person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t claim that\n","he or she is rich. But what if you add another? And another? And another?\n","At some point, you will have to admit that no one can be rich unless one\n","coin can make him or her so.\n","We can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny change transform\n","your life? It’s unlikely you would say so. But what if you made another? And\n","another? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that your life\n","was transformed by one small change.\n","e holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but\n","a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a\n","fundamental unit of the overall system.\n","In the beginning, small improvements can oen seem meaningless\n","because they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one coin\n","won’t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or\n","reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable diﬀerence.\n","Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one\n","another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a\n","grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your\n","favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it\n","feels easier to stick with good habits. e weight of the system is working for\n","you rather than against you.Over the course of this book, we’ve looked at dozens of stories about top\n","performers. We’ve heard about Olympic gold medalists, award-winning\n","artists, business leaders, lifesaving physicians, and star comedians who have\n","all used the science of small habits to master their cra and vault to the top\n","of their \u0000eld. Each of the people, teams, and companies we have covered has\n","faced diﬀerent circumstances, but ultimately progressed in the same way:\n","through a commitment to tiny, sustainable, unrelenting improvements.\n","Success is not a goal to reach or a \u0000nish line to cross. It is a system to\n","improve, an endless process to re\u0000ne. In Chapter 1, I said, “If you’re having\n","trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. e problem is your\n","system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t\n","want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.”\n","As this book draws to a close, I hope the opposite is true. With the Four\n","Laws of Behavior Change, you have a set of tools and strategies that you can\n","use to build better systems and shape better habits. Sometimes a habit will\n","be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious. Other times you\n","won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it attractive. In many cases,\n","you may \u0000nd that a habit will be too diﬃcult and you’ll need to make it easy.\n","And sometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it\n","satisfying.\n","Behaviors are eﬀortless here. Behaviors are diﬃcult here.\n","Obvious Invisible\n","Attractive Unattractive\n","Easy Hard\n","Satisfying Unsatisfying\n","You want to push your good habits toward the left side of the\n","spectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and\n","satisfying. Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits\n","toward the right side by making them invisible, unattractive,\n","hard, and unsatisfying.is is a continuous process. ere is no \u0000nish line. ere is no\n","permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate\n","through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you \u0000nd the next\n","bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it\n","satisfying. Round and round. Always looking for the next way to get 1\n","percent better.\n","e secret to getting results that last is to never stop making\n","improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. It’s\n","remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working. It’s\n","remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable\n","the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning. It’s remarkable the\n","fortune you can build if you don’t stop saving. It’s remarkable the friendships\n","you can build if you don’t stop caring. Small habits don’t add up. ey\n","compound.\n","at’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results.AppendixT\n","What Should You Read Next?\n","HANK YOU SO much for taking the time to read this book. It has been a\n","pleasure sharing my work with you. If you are looking for something to\n","read next, allow me to oﬀer a suggestion.\n","If you enjoyed Atomic Habits, then you may like my other writing as well.\n","My latest articles are sent out in my free weekly newsletter. Subscribers are\n","also the \u0000rst to hear about my newest books and projects. Finally, in\n","addition to my own work, each year I send out a reading list of my favorite\n","books from other authors on a wide range of subjects.\n","You can sign up at:\n","jamesclear.com/newsletterI\n","Little Lessons from the Four Laws\n","N THIS BOOK, I have introduced a four-step model for human behavior: cue,\n","craving, response, reward. is framework not only teaches us how to\n","create new habits but also reveals some interesting insights about human\n","behavior.\n","P r o b l e m  p h a s e\n","1 .  C u e\n","2 .  C r a v i n g\n","S o l u t i o n  p h a s e\n","3 .  R e s p o n s e\n","4 .  R e w a r d\n","In this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few bits of common\n","sense) that are con\u0000rmed by the model. e purpose of these examples is to\n","clarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework is when describing\n","human behavior. Once you understand the model, you’ll see examples of it\n","everywhere.\n","Awareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you assign\n","meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe\n","your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur aer you\n","have noticed an opportunity.\n","Happiness is simply the absence of desire. When you observe a cue, but\n","do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current\n","situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joyor satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no\n","urge to feel diﬀerently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer\n","want to change your state.\n","However, happiness is \u0000eeting because a new desire always comes along.\n","As Caed Budris says, “Happiness is the space between one desire being\n","ful\u0000lled and a new desire forming.” Likewise, suﬀering is the space between\n","craving a change in state and getting it.\n","It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. We seek the image of pleasure\n","that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it\n","will be like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). e feeling of\n","satisfaction only comes aerward. is is what the Austrian neurologist\n","Victor Frankl meant when he said that happiness cannot be pursued, it must\n","ensue. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues from action.\n","Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems.\n","e \u0000rst step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of\n","information, an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then\n","you are at peace.\n","Craving is about wanting to \u0000x everything. Observation without craving\n","is the realization that you do not need to \u0000x anything. Your desires are not\n","running rampant. You do not crave a change in state. Your mind does not\n","generate a problem for you to solve. You’re simply observing and existing.\n","With a big enough why you can overcome any how. Friedrich\n","Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has\n","a why to live for can bear almost any how.” is phrase harbors an important\n","truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough\n","(that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite\n","diﬃcult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high.\n","Being curious is better than being smart. Being motivated and curious\n","counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will\n","never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire,\n","not intelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “e trick\n","to doing anything is \u0000rst cultivating a desire for it.”\n","Emotions drive behavior. Every decision is an emotional decision at\n","some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel\n","compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage\n","to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action butstill will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. is is\n","why craving comes before response. e feeling comes \u0000rst, and then the\n","behavior.\n","We can only be rational and logical aer we have been emotional. e\n","primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our\n","\u0000rst response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for\n","feeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow, conscious portion\n","of the brain—is the part that does the “thinking.”\n","Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments)\n","versus System 2 (rational analysis). e feeling comes \u0000rst (System 1); the\n","rationality only intervenes later (System 2). is works great when the two\n","are aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional thinking when they are\n","not.\n","Your response tends to follow your emotions. Our thoughts and actions\n","are rooted in what we \u0000nd attractive, not necessarily in what is logical. Two\n","people can notice the same set of facts and respond very diﬀerently because\n","they run those facts through their unique emotional \u0000lter. is is one reason\n","why appealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to\n","reason. If a topic makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be\n","interested in the data. is is why emotions can be such a threat to wise\n","decision making.\n","Put another way: most people believe that the reasonable response is the\n","one that bene\u0000ts them: the one that satis\u0000es their desires. To approach a\n","situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your\n","response on the data rather than the emotion.\n","Suﬀering drives progress. e source of all suﬀering is the desire for a\n","change in state. is is also the source of all progress. e desire to change\n","your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes\n","humanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a\n","higher level. With craving, we are dissatis\u0000ed but driven. Without craving,\n","we are satis\u0000ed but lack ambition.\n","Your actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying\n","something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it.\n","It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal\n","your true motivations.Reward is on the other side of sacri\u0000ce. Response (sacri\u0000ce of energy)\n","always precedes reward (the collection of resources). e “runner’s high”\n","only comes aer the hard run. e reward only comes aer the energy is\n","spent.\n","Self-control is diﬃcult because it is not satisfying. A reward is an\n","outcome that satis\u0000es your craving. is makes self-control ineﬀective\n","because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting\n","temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for\n","the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than\n","satisfy it.\n","Our expectations determine our satisfaction. e gap between our\n","cravings and our rewards determines how satis\u0000ed we feel aer taking\n","action. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive\n","(surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the\n","future. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment and frustration), then\n","we are less likely to do so.\n","For example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you\n","expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your expectation\n","changes your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high\n","expectations is a disappointment. An average experience preceded by low\n","expectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are approximately the\n","same, you feel satis\u0000ed.\n","Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting\n","is is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is not\n","having too little, it is wanting more.” If your wants outpace your likes, you’ll\n","always be unsatis\u0000ed. You’re perpetually putting more weight on the\n","problem than the solution.\n","Happiness is relative. When I \u0000rst began sharing my writing publicly it\n","took me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that\n","milestone, I told my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated. I felt excited\n","and motivated. A few years later, I realized that one thousand people were\n","signing up each day. And yet I didn’t even think to tell anyone. It felt normal.\n","I was getting results ninety times faster than before but experiencing littlepleasure over it. It wasn’t until a few days later that I realized how absurd it\n","was that I wasn’t celebrating something that would have seemed like a pipe\n","dream just a few years before.\n","e pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation. When desire\n","is high, it hurts to not like the outcome. Failing to attain something you want\n","hurts more than failing to attain something you didn’t think much about in\n","the \u0000rst place. is is why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.”\n","Feelings come both before and aer the behavior. Before acting, there\n","is a feeling that motivates you to act—the craving. Aer acting, there is a\n","feeling that teaches you to repeat the action in the future—the reward.\n","Cue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)\n","How we feel in\u0000uences how we act, and how we act in\u0000uences how we\n","feel.\n","Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains. Wanting and liking are the two\n","drivers of behavior. If it’s not desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire\n","and craving are what initiate a behavior. But if it’s not enjoyable, you have no\n","reason to repeat it. Pleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior.\n","Feeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.\n","Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance. e \u0000rst\n","time an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be. Your expectation\n","(cravings) is based solely on promise. e second time around, your\n","expectation is grounded in reality. You begin to understand how the process\n","works and your hope is gradually traded for a more accurate prediction and\n","acceptance of the likely outcome.\n","is is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick\n","or weight-loss scheme. New plans oﬀer hope because we don’t have any\n","experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more\n","appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As\n","Aristotle noted, “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.”\n","Perhaps this can be revised to “Youth is easily deceived because it only\n","hopes.” ere is no experience to root the expectation in. In the beginning,\n","hope is all you have.OHow to Apply These Ideas to Business\n","VER THE YEARS, I’ve spoken at Fortune 500 companies and growing\n","start-ups about how to apply the science of small habits to run more\n","eﬀective businesses and build better products.

You can see my thoughts at atomichabits.com/cycling.* I geeked out and actually calculated this. Washington, D.C., is about 225\n","miles from New York City. Assuming you are \u0000ying on a 747 or an Airbus\n","A380, changing the heading by 3.5 degrees as you leave Los Angeles likely\n","causes the nose of the airplane to shi between 7.2 to 7.6 feet, or about 86 to\n","92 inches. A very small shi in direction can lead to a very meaningful\n","change in destination.* e terms unconscious, nonconscious, and subconscious can all be used to\n","describe the absence of awareness or thought. Even in academic circles,\n","these words are oen used interchangeably without much nitpicking (for\n","once). Nonconscious is the term I’m going to use because it is broad enough\n","to encompass both the processes of the mind we could never consciously\n","access and the moments when we are simply not paying attention to what\n","surrounds us. Nonconscious is a description of anything you are not\n","consciously thinking about.* Certainly, there are some aspects of your identity that tend to remain\n","unchanged over time—like identifying as someone who is tall or short. But\n","even for more \u0000xed qualities and characteristics, whether you view them in\n","a positive or negative light is determined by your experiences throughout\n","life.* Readers of e Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg will recognize these\n","terms. Duhigg wrote a great book and my intention is to pick up where he\n","le oﬀ by integrating these stages into four simple laws you can apply to\n","build better habits in life and work.* Charles Duhigg and Nir Eyal deserve special recognition for their\n","in\u0000uence on this image. is representation of the habit loop is a\n","combination of language that was popularized by Duhigg’s book, e Power\n","of Habit, and a design that was popularized by Eyal’s book, Hooked.* When I visited Japan, I saw this strategy save a woman’s life. Her young son\n","stepped onto the Shinkansen, one of Japan’s famous bullet trains that travel\n","at over two hundred miles per hour, just as the doors were closing. She was\n","le outside on the platform and jammed her arm through the door to grab\n","him. With her arm stuck in the door, the train was about to take oﬀ, but\n","right before it pulled away an employee performed a safety check by\n","Pointing-and-Calling up and down the platform. In less than \u0000ve seconds,\n","he noticed the woman and managed to stop the train from leaving. e door\n","opened, the woman—now in tears—ran to her son, and a minute later the\n","train departed safely.* Interested readers can get a template to create their own Habits Scorecard\n","at atomichabits.com/scorecard.* In addition to her payment for the library, Catherine the Great asked\n","Diderot to keep the books until she needed them and oﬀered to pay him a\n","yearly salary to act as her librarian.* Fogg refers to this strategy as the “Tiny Habits recipe,” but I'll call it the\n","habit stacking formula throughout the book.* If you’re looking for more examples and guidance, you can download a\n","Habit Stacking template at atomichabits.com/habitstacking.* Dopamine is not the only chemical that in\u0000uences your habits. Every\n","behavior involves multiple brain regions and neurochemicals, and anyone\n","who claims that “habits are all about dopamine” is skipping over major\n","portions of the process. It is just one of the important role players in habit\n","formation. However, I will single out the dopamine circuit in this chapter\n","because it provides a window into the biological underpinnings of desire,\n","craving, and motivation that are behind every habit.* I’m so happy I was able to \u0000t a Game of rones reference into this book.* is is just a partial list of underlying motives. I oﬀer a more complete list\n","and more examples of how to apply them to business at\n","atomichabits.com/business.* A similar story is told in the book Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted\n","Orland. It has been adapted here with permission. See the endnotes for a full\n","explanation.* is is a foundational principle in physics, where it is known as the\n","Principle of Least Action. It states that the path followed between any two\n","points will always be the path requiring the least energy. is simple\n","principle underpins the laws of the universe. From this one idea, you can\n","describe the laws of motion and relativity.* e phrase addition by subtraction is also used by teams and businesses to\n","describe removing people from a group in order to make the team stronger\n","overall.* To be fair, this still sounds like an amazing night.* I designed a habit journal speci\u0000cally to make journaling easier. It includes\n","a “One Line Per Day” section where you simply write one sentence about\n","your day. You can learn more at atomichabits.com/journal.* e irony of how closely this story matches my process of writing this\n","book is not lost on me. Although my publisher was much more\n","accommodating, and my closet remained full, I did feel like I had to place\n","myself on house arrest to \u0000nish the manuscript.* is is also referred to as a “Ulysses pact” or a “Ulysses contract.” Named\n","aer Ulysses, the hero of e Odyssey, who told his sailors to tie him to the\n","mast of the ship so that he could hear the enchanting song of the Sirens but\n","wouldn’t be able to steer the ship toward them and crash on the rocks.\n","Ulysses realized the bene\u0000ts of locking in your future actions while your\n","mind is in the right place rather than waiting to see where your desires take\n","you in the moment.* e shi to a delayed-return environment likely began around the advent\n","of agriculture ten thousand years ago when farmers began planting crops in\n","anticipation of a harvest months later. However, it was not until recent\n","centuries that our lives became \u0000lled with delayed-return choices: career\n","planning, retirement planning, vacation planning, and everything else that\n","occupies our calendars.* Time inconsistency is also referred to as hyperbolic discounting.* is can derail our decision making as well. e brain overestimates the\n","danger of anything that seems like an immediate threat but has almost no\n","likelihood of actually occurring: your plane crashing during a bit of\n","turbulence, a burglar breaking in while you’re home alone, a terrorist\n","blowing up the bus you’re on. Meanwhile, it underestimates what appears to\n","be a distant threat but is actually very likely: the steady accumulation of fat\n","from eating unhealthy food, the gradual decay of your muscles from sitting\n","at a desk, the slow creep of clutter when you fail to tidy up.* Interested readers can \u0000nd a habit tracker template at\n","atomichabits.com/tracker.* You can see the actual Habit Contracts used by Bryan Harris and get a\n","blank template at atomichabits.com/contract.* If you are interested in taking a personality test, you can \u0000nd links to the\n","most reliable tests here: atomichabits.com/personality.* If it’s Harry Potter on repeat, I feel you.* I have a pet theory about what happens when we achieve a \u0000ow state. is\n","isn’t con\u0000rmed. It’s just my guess. Psychologists commonly refer to the brain\n","as operating in two modes: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast and\n","instinctual. Generally speaking, processes you can perform very quickly\n","(like habits) are governed by System 1. Meanwhile, System 2 controls\n","thinking processes that are more eﬀortful and slow—like calculating the\n","answer to a diﬃcult math problem. With regard to \u0000ow, I like to imagine\n","System 1 and System 2 as residing on opposite ends of the spectrum of\n","thinking. e more automatic a cognitive process is, the more it slides\n","toward the System 1 side of the spectrum. e more eﬀortful a task is, the\n","more it slides toward System 2. Flow, I believe, resides on the razor’s edge\n","between System 1 and System 2. You are fully using all of your automatic\n","and implicit knowledge related to the task while also working hard to rise to\n","a challenge beyond your ability. Both brain modes are fully engaged. e\n","conscious and nonconscious are working perfectly in sync.* e discovery of variable rewards happened by accident. One day in the\n","lab, the famous Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner was running low on food\n","pellets during one experiment and making more was a time-consuming\n","process because he had to manually press the pellets in a machine. is\n","situation led him to “ask myself why every press of the lever had to be\n","reinforced.” He decided to only give treats to the rats intermittently and, to\n","his surprise, varying the delivery of food did not decrease behavior, but\n","actually increased it.* I created a template for readers interested in keeping a decision journal. It\n","is included as part of the habit journal at atomichabits.com/journal.* You can see my previous Annual Reviews at jamesclear.com/annual-\n","review.* You can see my previous Integrity Reports at jamesclear.com/integrity.* Sorites is derived from the Greek word sorós, which means heap or pile.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(separator='\\n',
